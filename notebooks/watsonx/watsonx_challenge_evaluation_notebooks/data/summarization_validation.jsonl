{"input":"Police investigating the historic murders of a Playboy bunny and a London schoolgirl have launched a fresh appeal for information on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of March 18, 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was brutally attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of March 18, 1975 . Lynne Weedon (left) was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she walked home on September 3, 1975 and her murder was linked to Miss Stratford's in 2007 when matching DNA was found on them - a former Met Police detective\u00a0believes Lynda Farrow (right) - knifed to death in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer . She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Both murders were linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford, worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was raped and killed in her home. Her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. She was found with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. She was last seen walking\u00a0alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March. This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . Miss Stratford, a Playboy bunny, was last seen walking alone near her home on a snowy day in March, 1975 . The Playboy bunny (pictured left) was found dead in the bedroom of her flat in\u00a0Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton (right) She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. Later that year, on September 3, Lynne Weedon was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later. The post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument, but the weapon was never recovered. Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Lynne's mother Margaret Weedon has now made an impassioned plea for information as the anniversary of her daughter's death approaches. She said: 'It has been 40 years since our beautiful young daughter Lynne was violently taken from us. '1975 seems so long ago and it is. Forty years without her. We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like - a true life sentence.' Mrs Weedon added: 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence.' Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said the suspect for both murders is likely to be in his 60s or 70s. He added: 'The man who carried out these murders is now of a different, older generation. I would imagine he must have reflected upon his actions every day over the past 40 years. 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Police believe the killer would have known of the Hounslow area - the alleyway and sub-station where Lynne was found were away from busy areas and meant her screams would have not been heard. Mrs Weedon said: 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Lynne was beaten and raped 30 yards from her home in Lampton Avenue, Hounslow (left) - she attended Lampton School (right) next to her house . Last week, former detective Colin Sutton pinned a third unsolved murder on the man who murdered Miss Stratford and Lynne. Mr Sutton, who solved the Levi\u00a0Bellfield and Night Stalker cases, believes Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. He told the Sun: 'I have no doubt the same man committed all three.' 'I was quickly struck by the similarities with that of Eve Stratford. 'A woman killed in her own home by having her throat slit? That is rare enough today \u2014 in the 1970s it was almost unheard of. 'For this to have happened twice, with identical wounds, within a few miles of each other was just too much of a coincidence.' He added: 'My gut feeling tells me he (the killer) is still out there some where and still nervous about a knock on his door.' Ms Farrow, a mother-of-two, was pregnant when she was stabbed to death at her home in Woodford, Essex, on January 19, 1979. When her daughters Sam, 11, and Justine, eight, returned from school at 3.30pm they found the door locked and looked through the letterbox where they saw their mother's body face down in the hall. The blood-stained murder weapon, a serrated carving knife, was found in the kitchen. Witnesses described seeing a man lingering in the area, wearing a check lumber jacket and cowboy hat. But he was never traced.

{"input":"There was no happy homecoming for Stuart McCall as he was forced to settle for a 1-1 draw against bottom side Livingston in his first game in charge of Rangers. The former Light Blues player was named as the club's 14th manager earlier in the week and his tenure looked set to get off to the best possible start when Haris Vuckic fired Rangers into an early lead. But Livi hit back through Ibra Sekajja on the stroke of half-time to claim a point. Stuart McCall (right) gestures on the touchline during his first match in charge of Rangers . Rangers players look dejected after Livingston equalised in the Scottish Championship clash . Rangers had been hoping the arrival of McCall would add a much-needed spark to their Scottish Championship promotion push. And the new manager was welcomed into the dug-out by wild applause from an Ibrox crowd of 35,066. McCall made three changes from the side who were held to a home draw by Queen of the South in midweek. Youngster Tom Walsh was handed his first start and Kenny Miller and Sebastien Faure were added to the side. The supporters were cheering again after just nine minutes when Rangers surged into an early lead. Miller's short pass found Nicky Law and he burst forward before setting up Vuckic for a left-foot strike that nestled in the bottom corner.

{"input":"How did iron become scattered throughout Earth's 2,000-mile (3,200km) thick mantle more than four billion years ago? That's a question that has puzzled scientists, with most thinking asteroid impacts were the cause, but now a new theory has been presented - iron rain. By re-analysing the vapourisation point of iron, a study has determined that conditions on early Earth would have caused iron to rain down on the ground. Scientists in New Mexico have a new theory for the origin of Earth's iron. Research suggests iron would have turned into vapour when meteorites hit the young Earth, as shown in the artist's impression above. The vapour would then have drifted up in plumes, condensed and then rained down on the surface of our planet . The research was conducted with the Z machine at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The machine is the most powerful producer of pulses of electrical energy on Earth. By studying the shock pressure required to vapourise iron, they found the value was 40 per cent less than previously thought. Astrophysicists say this lower pressure - 507 gigapascals (GPa) compared to 887 GPa - was easily achieved during the latter stages of Earth's formation. 'Because planetary scientists always thought it was difficult to vapourise iron, they never thought of vapourisation as an important process during the formation of Earth and its core,' said principal investigator Dr Rick Kraus. The researchers created a target - consisting of an iron plate 0.008in (5mm) square and 200 microns thick - against which they launched aluminum flyer plates travelling up to 16 miles (25km) per second. At this impact pressure, the powerful shock waves created in the iron cause it to compress, heat up and vapourise. The results showed that the vapourisation threshold for iron is 40 per cent lower than previously thought. 'But with our experiments, we showed that it's very easy to impact-vapourise iron.' The result of this would have been that a solid piece of iron, after impacting Earth perhaps as part of an asteroid, would disperse into an iron vapour due to the force of the impact. Earth is thought to have been pummelled by asteroids during the Late Heavy Bombardment period, 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago. Forming clouds across the surface, the vapour would then rain down onto the ground and mix with the mantle, which was molten at the time. 'This changes the way we think of planet formation, in that instead of core formation occurring by iron sinking down to the growing Earth's core in large blobs (technically called diapirs), that iron was vapourised, spread out in a plume over the surface of Earth and rained out as small droplets,' said Dr Kraus. 'The small iron droplets mixed easily with the mantle, which changes our interpretation of the geochemical data we use to date the timing of Earth's core formation.' The research, which found iron vapourised at values 40 per cent lower than thought, was conducted with the  Z machine (pictured) at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The machine is the most powerful producer of pulses of electrical energy on Earth . In previous theories, it was thought that iron arrived from collisions between Earth and planetesimals - rocks ranging in size from several metres to hundreds of kilometres in diameters. This would have happened in Earth's late formative stages more than four billion years ago, with the iron being sent bullet-like into the region between the core and crust - the mantle. But if that were true, then the moon would also have similar amounts of iron in its mantle, as it underwent the same bombardment - but this does not appear to be the case. This led the scientists to their new conclusion - and they add that the moon's gravity would have been too weak for it to have held onto iron rain-bearing vapour, like Earth. This accounts for the lack of iron seen scattered in the moon's mantle. According to the scientists, the moon's gravity would have been too weak for it to have held onto iron rain-bearing vapour, like Earth, during the Late Heavy Bombardment period (artist's impression of moon shown).

{"input":"Teachers may soon be able to lecture pupils, view their work and help them with any problems without ever stepping foot in the classroom. A school in Columbus Ohio has introduced a new robo-teacher into its classrooms to allow staff in other parts of the country to teach their pupils. The 4ft (1.2 metre) tall robot features a screen that broadcasts a video of the teacher's face  and a camera allows the teacher to see what is going on in the classroom. Scroll down for video . A school in Columbus Ohio has introduced a new robo-teacher into its classrooms to allow staff in other parts of the country to teach their pupils. The 4ft (1.2 metre) tall robot features a screen that broadcasts a video of the teacher's face and a camera allows the teacher to see what is going on in the classroom . Thomas Fetch, a social studies teacher at Nexus Academy of Columbus is one of the first to trial the robot, controlling it from his computer more than 1,600 miles (2,570km) away in Arizona. In the past the school has had to rely upon video calling and conference call style lessons for its remote teachers. British academics have helped develop a robot, which is both a home help and a friend to older people who may be ill, trapped and alone. The Care-O-bot 3 is much more like a utilitarian household appliance than the action figures that featured in the futuristic film iRobot, starring Will Smith. And she - or he - is more likely to offer a Karaoke sing along and make a cup of coffee than go on a murderous rampage - or at least that is the idea. The robot is the result of a collaboration between British and European academics under the umbrella of Accompany - Acceptable Robotics Companions for Ageing Years. The hope is that it will help older people to stay in their homes and live an independent life, rather than being moved miles away from friends and family into an expensive care home. With the help of the $6,000 (\u00a34,000) Telepresence robot, however, Mr Fetch can trundle between the desks and look at pupils work as they are doing it. Speaking to the Hechingerreport.org, Mr Fetch said: 'I like driving it around and feeling like I am in the school. It\u2019s neat to feel like I am part of the classroom. 'I was so far away, but with the help of this body I could walk around the building.' With robots increasingly being developed for use in healthcare, care homes and around the house, it was only a matter of time before they arrived in schools. The Nexus Academy of Columbus is part of a network of seven schools in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana that uses a mix of in-school teachers and remote teachers to hold lessons. Each of the schools now have one robot. However, Mr Fetch said there can be the odd technical hiccup - with the robot occasionally driving into doors and walls. He blamed this on the depth perception and peripheral vision of the robot not being 'that great.' It means that misbehaving pupils who might normally have been caught red handed out of the corner of the teacher's eye can possibly get away with it now. The robot could be a forerunner of schools of the future, rather like this scene from the cartoon the Jetsons . The robotic teachers do encounter the odd problem as the vision isn't great meaning they do drive into walls. The school's 120 pupils have reacted well to their robot teachers and said that being able to see the teacher's face in the classroom and being able to interact made the lessons feel more personal . According to Hechingerreport.org, who went to see the robots in action, the schools 120 pupils have reacted well to their robot teachers. They said that being able to see the teacher's face in the classroom and being able to interact made the lessons feel more personal. Thomas Hatch, one of the pupils at the school said:\u00a0'It sort of grew on me. 'Seeing the teacher\u2019s face, and they would be there, showing up in the room \u2013 it felt more personal than the just a screen.' The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example . A recent report by management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group predicted by 2025 the number of 'automatable' tasks will rise to 25 per cent. This will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in Japan. Earlier this week Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan unveiled its latest Robear. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms. And at the start of the month,\u00a0Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it will begin employing a humanoid called Nao in its branches from April, on a trial basis. And if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. Elsewhere, in China there is a hotel manned entirely by robots. From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, new employees. Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night's stay costs just \u00a36.80 per night. According to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies,  care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years. Her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes. She believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate, this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life. According to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots for the TC channel Syfy - traffic wardens (65 per cent), estate agents (40 per cent) and car salesman (33 per cent) could soon be lost to history.","output":"Teachers at The Nexus Academy of Columbus, Ohio, control 4ft tall robot .\nThey log in from as far away as Arizona to take lessons using the robot .\nA screen displays a video of their face while a camera allows them to see .\nPupils say the robot felt weird at first but it made lessons more personal .\nThe teacher can see the class and their work using the robot's camera ."}
{"input":"Jackie McNamara rounded on the Hampden officials for costing his side the chance of League Cup glory against Celtic. Referee Bobby Madden made two huge calls against Dundee United when, first of all, he denied Ryan Dow a first-half penalty following a nudge in the back by Parkhead skipper Scott Brown. The whistler then instantly dismissed Tannadice captain Sean Dillon for a dangerous tackle on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes, thus ending any hopes of a United comeback. Dundee United manager\u00a0Jackie McNamara was furious that his side were not awarded a penalty on Sunday . \u2018I feel frustrated and disappointed,\u2019 said McNamara. \u2018But I\u2019m proud of how the players responded. \u2018I thought a lot of things went against us today. We stuck to the task and went right to the end, despite the disappointments and setbacks in the game. \u2018Decisions didn\u2019t go for us and certain other things didn\u2019t go for us. I can\u2019t fault the lads for their effort and commitment. \u2018I feel we should have had a penalty. It looked like a penalty, I\u2019d like to see it again. The referee was very slow to make a decision, or not make a decision. But in Celtic\u2019s case, he was very quick to point to the spot. \u2018I\u2019d like to see the challenge again that caused the damage to Sean Dillon\u2019s leg. Celtic ended up getting a throw-in from it. Sean has got a bad gash on his shin. I\u2019d like to see the incident again, to see if it was a fair one. Dundee United's captain Sean Dillon is sent off by referee Bobby Madden for a tackle on Emilio Izaguirre . \u2018For the red card, Sean has given the referee a real decision to make. It was his momentum and pace, I don\u2019t think he has gone in to cause damage. But he\u2019s given the ref a decision to make and we know what happened.\u2019 United midfielder John Rankin, meanwhile, accused Celtic of piling pressure on to Madden ahead of Sunday\u2019s showpiece occasion. Following the stormy Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice, Celtic manager Ronny Deila had accused United youngster Aidan Connolly of a \u2018blatant\u2019 dive to win a spot-kick. That was then repeated by Brown, who also pointed the finger at Nadir Ciftci over a kick that struck him on the head. Anthony Stokes further spoke out by expressing his bemusement that Connolly hadn\u2019t been retrospectively punished. \u2018I think it did influence things,\u2019 said Rankin. \u2018It put pressure on the officials and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s merited. Ryan Dow was denied a first-half penalty following a nudge in the back by Parkhead skipper Scott Brown . \u2018The officials\u2019 jobs are hard enough without putting pressure on them. They\u2019re under scrutiny. \u2018You saw it last week with us going down to nine men and people questioning the decisions made then. \u2018There has been a lot of pressure put on Bobby Madden and his three officials this weekend with what they\u2019ve been saying in the press this week. \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s merited and it doesn\u2019t help.

Dundee United captain Sean Dillon (right) is sent off for this late challenge on Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre . \u2018Had we won today, we would have got back up for Wednesday. So we will dust them down and see who is available. Paul Dixon and Sean will both be missing. \u2018But the lads have another opportunity to put everything behind them. Hopefully there will be a bit of consistency in everything on Wednesday. \u2018We defended well with both 11 and 10 players today. Last week, we defended well with nine players, as well. Hopefully we keep 11 men on the pitch on Wednesday night. It\u2019s imperative that we do. \u2018Up until the last third of the pitch, we competed well with Celtic. But our last pass just wasn\u2019t there, although we had opportunities to create something. It\u2019s just that little bit of quality we were lacking. \u2018But they gave us everything and that\u2019s all you ask as a manager.

Mr Mitchell, 80, who is standing down as an MP in May, last week mischievously tweeted a picture of his own kitchen \u2013 complete with an unpacked bag of shopping and half-full glass of wine on the table \u2013 under the heading \u2018this is what a real Labour kitchen looks like\u2019. Yesterday he was sent a rebuke by Karl Turner, the shadow solicitor general, for the \u2018attack\u2019 on the party leader, warning him \u2018if you can\u2019t say anything supportive, keep your opinion to yourself\u2019. Austin Mitchell tweeted this photograph with the caption: 'This is what a real Labour kitchen looks like' It is just the latest twist in the drama about Mr Miliband\u2019s domestic set-up after he and wife Justine were filmed for a BBC interview having tea in a very small, empty kitchen with no seating area. In response to criticism, a family friend tweeted that the kitchen in the Milibands\u2019 \u00a32million North London townhouse was \u2018lovely\u2019 and that this was a \u2018functional kitchenette\u2019 for making \u2018tea and snacks\u2019. While most Labour MPs have resisted comment on the issue, Mr Mitchell fuelled the fire this weekend by tweeting: \u2018Labour\u2019s new pledge card promises two kitchens for all by 2030, two toilets by 2035.\u2019 Last week, in a jibe at the Conservatives\u2019 so-called bedroom tax, the veteran MP for Great Grimsby, had said: \u2018Tories to introduce spare kitchen tax\u2019. Mr Turner wrote him a letter, which Mr Mitchell duly published on his website yesterday, which read: \u2018You\u2019re a joke Austin.

Mr Turner, the MP for Hull East, added that Mr Miliband \u2018has one in Donny [his constituency in Doncaster] and mine\u2019s massive in East Hull.\u2019 It is a reference to Labour MPs\u2019 thinking that Mr Mitchell has done little to help them campaign to keep the seat. It is the only Labour seat in the country which pollsters believe Ukip has a chance of winning. The veteran MP, who is an outspoken Eurosceptic, has also infuriated the leadership by claiming in a recent article that his party was promoting too many young women. He said Labour, which has used all-women shortlists to boost their numbers of female MPs, was \u2018undergoing the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier every day.\u2019 Mr Mitchell claimed that as a result, Labour was becoming more \u2018family- friendly, gentler\u2019 but \u2018less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind\u2019. He also claimed that \u2018ageism is rampant\u2019 in the party, and that while he was standing down because \u2018I\u2019d rather not die in public\u2019 other Labour MPs over 60, were being \u2018carried out kicking and screaming\u2019.","output":"Austin Mitchell mischievously tweeted a picture of his kitchen last week .\nHe accompanied image with: 'This is what a real Labour kitchen looks like'\nThe MP has been scolded by the party's high command for poking fun ."}
{"input":"A video emerged today that claims to show Oscar Pistorius playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal. The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder. The disgraced sprinter, who was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has struck up an unlikely friendship with the Czech fugitive since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria. In the 90 second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves. Kickabout: A video emerged that claims to show Oscar Pistorius (white T-shirt) playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal, seen here taking on the role of goalkeeper in a penalty shoot-out . Enjoying some freedom: The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder . Wide of the mark: Pistorius's shot misses the goal and hits a door instead. The double-amputee was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 . Incarcerated: The disgraced sprinter has struck up an unlikely friendship with Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir (right) since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria . The footage, shot from above on a mobile phone reportedly by a convicted robber, was published today by South Africa's Daily Sun newspaper. The pictures appear to support recent reports that the double-amputee has slimmed down dramatically since his incarceration four months ago amid fears of poisoning by other prisoners. According to jail sources, the shamed athlete is surviving on tins of baked beans, pilchards and an African vegetable dish called 'chakalaka' bought at the prison tuck shop after spurning his rations. Wearing trainers, grey shorts and a white, unbranded T-shirt that appears to swamp his lean frame, the 28-year-old's thin arms protrude from its sleeves. The images are in stark contrast to the muscle-bound track star who made history at the London Olympic games by competing against able-bodied athletes. During the day, Pistorius is required to dress in the regulation orange jump suit which is issued to all inmates at the jail. Fun and games: In the 90-second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves . As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete . But according to a spokesman for the jail, he is entitled to dress in sports gear for his hour of daily exercise. As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete. Although in the video Pistorius appears to move easily on his prostheses despite his obvious drop in weight, during his long murder trial, his doctor told the court of the pain the fallen sprinter suffers a result of wearing artificial limbs that fit poorly as a result of weight loss. The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population. For the purposes of their football game, the doors provide make-shift goal posts and Pistorius shows himself to be useful in goal, deflecting the older man's attempt to score by blocking one shot with a prosthetic leg. At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand. In apparent deference to his opponent, the Paralympic gold medalist is seen moving a concrete-weighted pole and plastic bag out of the way in order for Krejcir to have more room to take aim at the goal. The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population . At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand . When it is his own turn to take penalties, Pistorius strikes hard, but hits one of the door 'goal posts', before sprinting off to reclaim the ball \u2013 clearly relishing the short burst of speed. Prison chiefs are mindful of the threat to Pistorius's safety at the massive jail, where gangs dominate prison life and sexual and physical violence is the only means to progress up the gangs' chain of command. He spends much of his day isolated from other prisoners, but Krejcir \u2013 despite his links with violent crime \u2013 is obviously perceived to pose no danger. Last month, MailOnline exclusively revealed how Pistorius had been re-classified to a low-risk A category prisoner, entitling him to greater freedoms and privileges behind bars, including 'contact' visits, a radio and the freedom to wear jewelry. The Daily Sun newspaper, which received the footage from a prisoner inside the jail, quoted an unnamed inmate who complained that Krejcir and Pistorius were getting preferential treatment because they are both white. The paper reports that Pistorius is given mineral water, fresh fruit and tea for breakfast - treats that are not afforded to other prisoners and prepared only for him. 'We are all in prison and we must be treated the same. The colour of your skin should not be a passport to get on the sweet side of the law,' the prisoner told the paper. The noise of the prison, which houses 7,000 inmates, can be heard on the video soundtrack, drowning any exchanges between the two men. Stark: Prisoners are lined up inside the Kgosi Mumpuru 11 Management Centre during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband. Pistorius is being held in the hospital wing of jail . Grim: Prison officials search an inmate's cell. Pistorius is said to be quiet and calm in prison after an initial meltdown during his first few days when other inmates heard him sobbing himself to sleep (file picture) Krejcir, currently on trial for kidnapping, attempted murder and drug dealing, appears to enjoy the yard knockabout. The Czech fugitive is facing a long incarceration as a prisoner on remand, with a number of outstanding cases against him. Detectives said it would take years to wrap up investigations into the Czech's links with the criminal underworld including murder, drug trafficking, robbery and fraud. Krejcir currently has three court cases running against him, but as an unconvicted prisoner is entitled to greater privileges than his neighbour on the hospital wing. Krecjir's latest charge involves the murder of a Lebanese national who was shot more than 30 times when he stopped at a traffic light in Johannesburg 18 months ago. News of the unlikely friendship between the two was revealed when Krejcir wrote a letter to prison authorities complaining that a treadmill and exercise bike \u2013 that he trained on alongside Pistorius \u2013had been removed from the corridor outside his cell. Krejcir used a false passport to move to South Africa seven years ago and has been linked to the unsolved murders of, among others, a luxury car exporter, the owner of a string of strip joints and a known drug dealer. Victim and killer: Model Reeva Steenkamp died after Pistorius fired four shots at her through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentine's Day two years ago . In 2013 he survived an attempt on his own life which involved remotely-operated guns which had been hidden - 007-style - behind the number plate of a parked car. In December, the double-amputee's brother told South Africa's YOU magazine how the athlete had hoped to begin a basketball training programme for inmates, many of whom suffer from ill health due to HIV, Aids and TB. According to Carl, Pistorius had requested a donation of basketballs from his family in order to set up the project after applying for permission from prison bosses. In October, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide over the death of 29 year-old Mrs Steenkamp at his home on St Valentine's Day 2013. The double-amputee shot the model four times through a locked toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder. He could be released from jail in August and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. However, the state has appealed Pistorius' acquittal on a charge of murder. The athlete's own lawyers have challenged the ruling to allow the appeal. The next hearing in the case is due to take place on Friday.","output":"Video appears to show the killer athlete having a kickabout in\u00a0prison\u00a0yard .\nEnjoys penalty shoot-out with notorious Czech 'gangster' Radovan Krejcir .\nPictures appear to support claims sprinter has dramatically slimmed down .\nHe struck up friendship with Krejcir after sharing gym on hospital wing ."}

From next year, the government's Progress 8 league table measure will replace the five A* to C benchmark. Failure to meet the target could leave schools at risk of takeover or even closure. Experts say pupils are being pushed into more GCSEs in the so-called English Baccalaureate subjects (file picture) Students' performance will be tracked in eight subjects split into three groups: English and maths, which will be given double weighting; three EBac subjects (sciences, computer science, geography, history and languages) and three optional subjects. But the Design and Technology Association (DATA) has warned that schools are urging students to take further EBac subjects as 'optional subjects', leaving them less time to pursue creative interests. DATA chief executive, Richard Green, told the Times Educational Supplement: 'If a student is doing history then (schools) are advising them to take geography as well, and the same with sciences and languages.

{"input":"(CNN)The family of Michael Brown, the teen killed last year by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case \"very shortly,\" attorney Anthony Gray said Thursday. Neither he nor attorney Daryl Parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed, but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury's and the Justice Department's decisions not to charge Wilson in the shooting. \"They have accepted (Wilson's) self-defense,\" Parks told reporters. \"We do not accept his self-defense.\" The slain teen's parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys, Parks said. \"The last 24 hours have been tough for them,\" he said. Word of the lawsuit comes a day after the Justice Department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge Wilson in Brown's death but found in a separate investigation that the Ferguson Police Department showed a pattern of racial bias. Brown Sr. and McSpadden released a statement Wednesday saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face charges, but, they added, the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining. \"We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,\" the statement said. \"It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain.\" In November, a grand jury cleared Wilson and, in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered. Gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on \"pretty much the same evidence,\" but it will be cast differently. The jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, Parks said. Summing up the crux of the Brown family's case, Parks said, \"There were other alternatives available to (Wilson). He did not have to kill Michael Brown.\"","output":"Attorney says jury in civil lawsuit will make decision based on lower burden of proof .\nWord of the lawsuit comes a day after Justice Department declines to charge Darren Wilson ."}

{"input":"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is promising an exciting summer of recruitment at Selhurst Park after the club effectively guaranteed their Premier League survival with a comeback victory at Stoke City. Palace are now 11 points clear of the drop zone and Pardew can think about building for next season, buoyed by the new Sky Sports TV deal and a possible takeover from American businessman Josh Harris. Recruitment is now uppermost in Pardew\u2019s mind and he revealed: \u2018We are getting calls regarding players from Inter Milan and Benfica because they are our market now. Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Stoke 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium . Pardew (left) congratulates wing wizard Yannick Bolasie at full-time after Palace's impressive victory . Wilfried Zaha has scored in his last two games against QPR and Stoke, the first time he\u2019s netted consecutively since October 2012 in his first spell with Palace . \u2018Palace now come into the same group as everybody below the likes of Everton, Tottenham and Liverpool, and the most important thing is to try to trade well. \u2018It\u2019s important to preserve your Premier League status early. If you leave it late, it is very difficult to get players. You don\u2019t want other teams putting packages together and working on players before you can. \u2018We are pretty secure in approaching clubs and players now as a Premier League side for next season and that\u2019s what we will do. We have the finance to do what we say we are going to do. So it does give us a slight advantage.\u2019 One player who will remain is reborn winger Wilfried Zaha who scored the winner at The Britannia for his first back-to-back goals since 2012. In February, Wilfried Zaha (right) was sad, but according to Alan Pardew he is now playing with a smile . Zaha signed for Manchester United after Palace's promotion, but his career nosedived at Old Trafford . Zaha\u2019s career nosedived after a \u00a315million move to Manchester United went sour and he has gone from being capped by England to not even making the Under 21 squad. He was ordered to smile more and sulk less by Pardew last week and celebrated his goal at Stoke by playfully sticking out his tongue. \u2018He looked a sad player when I arrived (from Newcastle in January),\u2019 said Pardew. \u2018You are never going to play your best football when you're sad and sometimes good management is not about tactics but inspiring players. He was down in the dumps for whatever reason. \u2018Young players need that exuberance, particularly with the way he plays. And smiling and being happy is part of that exuberance.\u2019 Nonetheless, 22-year-old Zaha doesn\u2019t plan on transforming himself into a cartoon clown. \u2018I do smile when I need to!,\u2019 he stressed. Crystal Palace players celebrate with Glenn Murray after he scored a penalty to draw Palace level . Stoke manager Mark Hughes was distraught with two key decisions by referee Andre Marriner . \u2018When it is time to be serious, I\u2019m serious. When it is time to play around I will play around. \u2018We\u2019ve got the points we\u2019ve needed to now so we can play without pressure and enjoy the rest of the season.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t much hilarity from beaten Stoke manager Mark Hughes who felt his side were robbed by two key decisions from referee Andre Marriner after taking a 14th-minute lead from Mame Diouf. Hughes has joined West Brom manager Tony Pulis in saying technology should be brought in immediately to stop the wrong decisions being made. The Stoke boss was furious that Mr Marriner awarded Palace a penalty when Asmir Begovic and Yannick Bolasie collided and Glenn Murray levelled from the spot. And after Zaha had put Palace ahead, the official waved away a strong appeal for handball against Palace defender Joel Ward. Hughes believes that Palace defender Joel Ward (right) was guilty of handball in the penalty area . Hughes slammed the standard of refereeing in the Premier League this season . Hughes said: \u2018It was clear to everybody that he has thrown his body, his arms to stop the ball going goalwards. It was a shot on target, he was not close to the ball, he was about five yards away so it was a clear penalty. \u2018I don\u2019t think the standard of refereeing this year has been as good as it needs to be. They need a little bit of help and I\u2019m an advocate of TV replays. \u2018I think it is quite simple. If a big decision is made, he needs to ask the question: is there any reason why I should not give a penalty, or why I should not give a goal. Within 10 or 15 seconds they can give the referee an answer and there will be more correct decisions. They need to be given that option because at the moment they need a lot more help. \u2018I think we have reached a tipping point. Before there were debates one way or the other but now I think it needs to come in.\u2019","output":"Crystal Palace came from a goal behind to beat Stoke 2-1 on Saturday .\nPalace are now 11 points clear of the drop zone in the Premier League .\nAlan Pardew says they are getting calls regarding players from Inter Milan and Benfica because 'they are our market now'\nThe Palace boss says Wilfried Zaha was down in the dumps when he arrived but is now playing with a smile on his face ."}

Author Martin Tarbuck, from Wigan, Lancashire, had his fingers in a total of 314 pastries on his search for the best the country has to offer. The 41-year-old judged each pie on a number of \u00a0important criteria - purveyor, premises, purchase, place, pastry, presentation, package, palate, price, and portion - as part of his research for a book on British pies. Scroll down for video . Martin Tarbuck ate 314 pies over the course of 700 days to find Britain's best pastry . A humble meat and potato pie from a bakers in Cumbria topped the chart, with Martin describing it as 'softer than an angel crying on your tongue'. The pie-mad author said: 'Sometimes I go looking for the pie, sometimes the pie finds me. Sometimes it's a shop recommendation, sometimes I just hit a particular town or city and see what it has got to offer. 'People, towns, cities and counties are proud of their pies and love to make and eat their own regional variations of them. 'It was my staple diet for 700 days, although I was prepared to mix it up a bit in the interests of research. There were also pasties, chunky steak pies, breakfast items, and chicken and mushroom pies.'

'Layer after layer of thick spud slice expanding like a concertina. It looks like one of those penny drops at the fairground where the chutes zig zag. 'Absolute pastry perfection. I'm in love.' The 41-year-old's love of pies originates from his hometown - arguably the pie capital of the UK. 'It is the duty of a Wigan man to sample as many pies as is humanly possible from around the world,' he said. 'For many decades large swathes of professional and amateur commentators alike have laughed at the town of Wigan and mocked its inhabitants for being pie eating simpletons. 'Nevertheless what I discovered during my research is that pies are not necessarily a Wigan thing. They are a national treasure where each area has its individual intricacies and delicacies. 'You know the way Hugh Hefner parades around his Beverley Hills mansion in his dressing gown surrounded by a bevy of poolside beauties? 'Well that's how I feel when you put pies in front of me through my eyes, there's no ugly ones and each and every one of them deserves to be loved equally.' The Wigan native crowned a humble meat and potato pie from a bakers in Cumbria as Britain's best . And after years of practice in eating them, he has firm rules as to how they should be consumed. Martin said: 'A pie has to be completely encased for a start - otherwise there's no chance of eating it with your hands, and the top crust should be the decorative invitation to the party that lies within. 'Oh and if that pastry falls apart, then so do I. With rage.' Martin has penned a book on finding the perfect pie - with in depth reviews of each and every one he has sunk his teeth into.

Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined \u00a32,000 in March 2014 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for Torquay - a charge which he denied. Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities. Stevenage's Ronnie Henry (in the white) accused Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie of biting him . 'So in passing comment, word is around the place that there's been an incident and the police are involved. He's (Henry) not in a good situation, he's in the treatment room and he's suffered quite a nasty injury. 'Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don't go on a football pitch expecting to lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it's a football match and he's nearly lost his finger.' The game had already threatened to boil over before Labadie and Henry's clash due to the nature of Dagenham's winning goal. Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for Dean Howell to score. But only after long consultation with his assistant did referee Dean Whitestone award the goal. Stevenage manager Graham Westley said that the alleged incident had become a 'police matter' In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal. Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club. Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup.
