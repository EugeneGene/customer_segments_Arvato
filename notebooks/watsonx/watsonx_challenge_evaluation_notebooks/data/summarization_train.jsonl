Race for survival: One Chinese man is so convinced the world will end next month he is building his very own Noah's Ark (pictured) The vessel, which has cost him \u00a51million (\u00a3100,000), measures 21.2m long, 15.5m wide, 5.6m high and displaces about 140 tons of water. Lu, from Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, admits it's not much to look at, but is confident it will serve its purpose. Scientists and researchers are going out of their way to assure people that December 21, 2012, the so-called Mayan end-date, will not bring about the end of the world. But that hasn't stopped some from ploughing on with their own safety measures regardless. Faith: Lu has spent his whole life savings of \u00a3100,000 on the boat, which he believes will save him from an impending global disaster .

Doomsday refuge: The Pic de Bugarach, south-west France, where some believe an alien spacecraft will burst out taking humans away from an apocalypse . Expectations: With the Aztec Mayan calendar, pictured, ending on or around December 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world . The significance of December 21, 2012, stems from interpretations of the Maya Long Count calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns. Experts estimate the system starts counting at 3114 BC and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around that day. However, experts say that while 13 was a significant number for the Maya, the end of that cycle would be a milestone \u2014 but not an end. Geoffrey Braswell, an anthropologist at the University of California at San Diego, said: 'The Maya long count system is like a car odometer. 'My first car (odometer) only had six wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles. 'That didn't mean the car would explode after reaching 100,000 miles.' As the clock winds down to December 21, experts on the Maya calendar have been racing to convince people that the Maya didn't predict an apocalypse for the end of this year. Some experts are now saying the Maya may indeed have made prophecies, just not about the end of the world. Archaeologists, anthropologists and other experts met in September in the southern Mexico city of Merida to discuss the implications of the Maya Long Count calendar, which some interpret as signalling the end of the world on December 21. Meanwhile, only a couple of references to the 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at Maya sites and neither refers to an apocalypse, experts say. Such apocalyptic visions have been common for more than 1,000 years in Western, Christian thinking, and are not native to Maya thought. Experts stressed that the ancient Maya, whose 'classic' culture of writing, astronomy and temple complexes flourished from the year 300AD to 900AD, were extremely interested in future events, far beyond December 21.","output":"Lu Zhenghai splashes out \u00a3100,000 on disaster-proof vessel .\nSome believe Mayans predicted end of world on Dec 21, 2012 ."}
{"input":"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 20:19 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 29 October 2013 . How many Government schools inspectors would approve of a half-naked teacher who instructed his pupils in the finer points of anarchic terrorism? That was the approach taken by Jim Cogan, an English teacher at my old school, Westminster, in the Eighties. Mr Cogan, who had done his National Service in Nigeria with the West African Frontier Force, liked to teach outside, often stripped to his vest. Privileged: Harry Mount claims Nick Clegg, who attended Westminster school in the 1980s, owes his success to his teachers, most of whom had no formal teaching qualification . On sunny summer days, he marched the class to the boundary of the cricket pitch in nearby Vincent Square, asking pupils to compose an instant essay on \u2018How cricket is like life\u2019. Cogan was a Shakespeare scholar, expert at guiding pupils towards Oxbridge with his vast memory bank of quotes from English literature. At the same time, he told his pupils that all Oxbridge colleges should be blown up, to end the wicked class divide. If Jim Cogan\u2019s old pupil, Nick Clegg, had his way, this maverick genius wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to give 35 years of his life to inspiring Westminster pupils. Mr Cogan studied classics and English at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but he never got the formal teaching qualification Clegg insists all teachers at free schools must have. Barely any of the gifted teachers who taught me and Nick Clegg \u2014 I was four years below the Deputy Prime Minister \u2014 had a teaching qualification. As a result, our elite education was blissfully free from the blunt, oafish, centralised government intervention Clegg is demanding for less privileged children. Nick Clegg wasn\u2019t one of the more intelligent boys when he was at Westminster School from 1980 to 1985. 'He was a genius who taught for the love of his subject' The clever pupils at Westminster \u2014 one of the best, and most expensive, schools in the country, costing \u00a332,490 a year \u2014 were \u2018accelerated\u2019. That meant they did O-levels after two, as opposed to three, years. Clegg, one of the less bright sparks, was selected for the three-year option. Still, that didn\u2019t stop him making it into Robinson College, Cambridge, in 1986, and, from there, on to the smooth-running conveyor belt to life\u2019s glittering prizes: a scholarship at Minnesota University, an MA at the College of Europe in Bruges, a job with the European Commission and a spell as an MEP, before becoming an MP. None of this would have been possible without the rocket-boosters attached to his middle-ranking talents by Westminster\u2019s teachers. I was largely taught by the same teachers \u2014 they stayed at the school a long time, attracted by the freedom to teach in the way they wanted, not hamstrung by the foot-dragging, equality-obsessed, knowledge-hating forces of the State education machine. They taught for the love of their subject and were restricted neither by any national curriculum \u2014 which Clegg is also insisting all free school teachers must follow \u2014 nor much of a school curriculum. That day\u2019s topic could be changed on the spot. Mount says new rules would drive free-thinking, inspirational teachers away from state schools and into private ones such as Westminster (pictured) I remember the assassination of Indira Gandhi, India\u2019s Prime Minister, in October 1984. I was 13, in my first term, and our English teacher, David Edwards, decided on a whim to devote the lesson to studying her legacy rather than reading Julius Caesar, our O-level set book. Of course, we\u2019d end up reading Julius Caesar and doing well in those exams, but only as a sideshow in the general mission to enjoy literature; not as the be-all and end-all of the two years of lessons \u2014 or, in Clegg\u2019s case, three years \u2014 leading to our O-levels. The teachers used a deft combination of carrot and stick. David Hepburne-Scott \u2014 an Old Etonian who taught physics to me and Clegg and was rarely seen without his Eton tie \u2014 could be terrifying. But his\u00a0 lessons were wonderfully original. He taught the physics of heat transfer by telling us that, to warm up a cold bottle of red wine quickly before a dinner party, we must stick it behind the fridge \u2014 where warm air is expelled. In the same lesson that he taught us Bernoulli\u2019s principle \u2014 which explains why aeroplanes fly \u2014 he also told us how to fold our jackets before putting them in a suitcase: turn one arm inside out, fold once vertically, then again horizontally. I still do it today on holiday \u2014 and I remember Bernoulli\u2019s principle, too. Hepburne-Scott also had an uplifting disregard for petty rules. On a trip to a railway museum, he jumped into the cab of a stationary locomotive, beckoned a group of boys aboard, and headed, steaming, off into the sunset. 'My other maths teacher, Tristram Jones-Parry, a planet-brained mathematician, tried to teach at a State school when he left Westminster and was denied a job because he wasn't 'qualified\"' My maths teacher, Michael Hugill, taught statistics by comparing the length of words used by the novelists Anthony Powell and Evelyn Waugh in 100-word extracts from their books. Tellingly, my other maths teacher, Tristram Jones-Parry, a planet-brained mathematician, later the headmaster, tried to teach at a State school when he left Westminster \u2014 and was denied a job because he wasn\u2019t \u2018qualified\u2019. His old pupil, Nick Clegg, must have been delighted. Jones-Parry was formidable figure. He once bellowed at the young Helena Bonham Carter, who took her A-levels at Westminster: \u2018You can\u2019t dress up as if you\u2019re about to go out and milk the cows!\u2019 Richard Stokes, Clegg\u2019s German teacher \u2014 last year awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for \u2018great service rendered to British-German relations\u2019 \u2014 taught his subject through German poems set to music by Schubert and Mozart. Stokes was another \u2018untrained\u2019 but inspirational man who admitted that while at Oxford, he\u2019d get one of the girls from Somerville College to check his translations which were always littered with \u2018howlers\u2019. Of course, Westminster in the Clegg years wasn\u2019t a sepia-tinted paradise, with a common room entirely populated by adored Mr Chips types. As in any school, some of the teachers weren\u2019t much good. Free schools, like private schools, currently don't require teachers to take a formal qualification before joining the staff . And it helped that the pupils were from comfortable, middle-class backgrounds, often with book-lined drawing rooms at home. It helped, too, that practically all the teachers had been to Oxbridge. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean less privileged children wouldn\u2019t benefit from the teaching techniques that sent droves of Westminster pupils to Oxbridge and professional careers. Wicked, patronising critics insist State schools can\u2019t follow the same methods that make private schools the best in the world. 'Talented, free-thinking, unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones.' And Nick Clegg isn\u2019t alone in denying poor children the advantages he benefited from by an accident of birth. Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt \u2014 son of a peer, educated at fee-paying University College School and Trinity College, Cambridge \u2014 insists teachers must have qualifications, even though he has taught in schools in his Stoke constituency without one himself. Clegg and Hunt come from a long line of privately educated, Left-wing politicians, who pull up the drawbridge behind them. Shirley Williams, Education Secretary under James Callaghan, was beautifully educated at St Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School and Somerville College, Oxford, but was determined to get rid of private and grammar schools. Anthony Crosland (Highgate School and Trinity College, Oxford), Harold Wilson\u2019s Education Secretary, famously said: \u2018If it\u2019s the last thing I do, I\u2019m going to destroy every f***ing grammar school in England. And Wales and Northern Ireland.\u2019 Who wouldn\u2019t want to be free of their hypocritical grasp? The idea behind Michael Gove\u2019s free schools is they should be\u00a0 free, if not entirely independent, of the dead hand of Government. But Nick Clegg is trying to keep a Government grip on them, keep them attached to what Michael Gove calls \u2018the blob\u2019 \u2014 the immovable, stodgy mass of the State-education establishment. The result? Talented, free-thinking, unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones. Westminster\u2019s teachers were brilliant because they were free from State indoctrination, free from a Government curriculum, free from the dim limitations of groupthink. Free, too, to scream at, expel or suspend anyone they wanted. And they haven\u2019t been on strike in 453 years. Harry Mount is a tutor and teaches architectural history at a London art school. He doesn\u2019t have a teaching qualification.","output":"Harry Mount went to same private school as Nick Clegg .\nSays most teachers had no formal teaching qualifications .\nHowever they were inspirational and brought pupils success .\nClegg to force every teacher to have qualification including in free schools .\nMount says this will drive maverick educators from state to private schools ."}

A member of Jodi Arias' legal team has been banned from visiting her in jail after she was caught bringing a piece of the convicted murderer's art out of the Arizona facility. Maria De La Rosa, a mitigation specialist who is trying to build a case that will humanize Arias and help convince a jury not to sentence her to death, was found carrying one of Arias' drawings out of the Maricopa County jail in late February. De La Rosa and the rest of Arias' legal team argued that the artwork is part of her defense case, and they planned to display it to the jury when her sentencing trial begins on September 8. Ban: Maria De La Rosa, seen right next to Jodi Arias after her guilty verdict was handed down in May, was found bringing one of Arias' drawings out of prison and is no longer allowed to visit as a result . The sheriff's office was concerned that she was carrying the drawing- which showed a multi-color drawing of a pinwheel- on behalf of Arias in order to deliver it to someone on the outside. 'The only material provided to Maria was legal material, and I find what the jail is doing is outrageous,' Ms De La Rosa's attorney Dan Raynak told The Arizona Republic. 'I personally find it outrageous, because Maria is beyond reproach and is one of the finest mitigation specialists I've worked with.' One of Arias' lawyers from her murder trial confirmed that they regularly brought her artwork out of prison because they presented some of it during the five-month trial that started on January 2, 2013 and ended on May 8 after the jury reached a guilty verdict following 15 hours of deliberation. Color work: Jodi Arias has been producing drawings while in prison as she waits to have a new jury determine whether she will face the death penalty or life in jail . Arias, who murdered her boyfriend Travis Alexander, is in jail awaiting a second round in court where a new jury will determine whether or not she should be sentenced to the death penalty or life in prison. The sentencing trial is set for September 8 after rounds of delays. Arias, a photographer by trade, has been working actively on her drawing skills and\u00a0 used it as a form of income during her trial by selling off works that she made from behind bars. Supporters have maintained a website where her work is available for sale. Waiting for the next step: Arias' lawyers also put in a motion to have the possibility of the death penalty taken out of the jury's range of options but no verdict has been handed down on that . Her rates have gone down dramatically since her guilty verdict was handed down in May, however. Her drawings were being sold for thousands at the peak of the trial- like one of Grace Kelly that went for $3,050- as opposed to the two drawings currently available on the site. Both pieces- one of a sailboat at sunset and another of a vase of calla lillies- are on sale for $39. The Arizona Republic reports that Arias' legal team submitted multiple motions to Judge Sherry Stephens on Monday including one to allow Ms De La Rosa to be able to visit the county jails both for Arias and her other death row clients. Another motion pushed for the death penalty to be removed from the list of options that will be presented to the new jury.","output":"Maria De La Rosa, a mitigation specialist working with Arias' legal team, has been caught bringing one of the murderer's drawings out of prison .\nJudge has since banned her from visiting Arias or any of her other clients .\nRosa, whose job it is to try to humanize Arias to the sentencing jury, said that it has been common practice because they feature her art in court .\nArias was found guilty in May of murdering her ex boyfriend Travis Alexander but the jury couldn't decide on her sentence .\nA different sentencing jury will convene on September 8 to determine whether she should be put to death or face life in jail ."}

'Give me a chance,' the soft-spoken vet said. 'Let's show a little respect for this occasion.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT: Protesters stormed into Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden's town hall meeting Saturday in Portland, refusing to leave and eventually shutting the event down . Wyden planned to honor 100-year-old Dario Raschio and tweeted that he was pleased 'to present my neighbor with long-overdue medals he earned in WWII' 'I'LL BUST YOUR JAW, OLD MAN!': One activist (right) threatened to harm a campus public safety officer if protesters weren't allowed inside . 'God bless America. And you people who are here for a cause, whatever it might be \u2013 show respect to Senator Wyden,' he urged, bringing an eruption of applause from the audience. But the boisterous chants grew so loud \u2013 including shouts for a $15 minimum wage and the end of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East \u2013 that the meeting was disbanded 45 minutes after it was scheduled to begin. Raschio's medal presentation was the only part of the day's agenda that actually happened. The senator awarded him the U.S. Naval Aviator Badge, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the \"Ruptured Duck\" award and the U.S. Navy Honorable discharge pin. He also received a flag that was flown over the U.S Capitol in Washington, D.C. Wyden never got a chance to conduct his planned question-and-answer session with the public. NOT AMUSED: The audience sat and watched the drama unfold but never got to ask the senator any questions after the meeting was hijacked .

Wyden is a far-left politician who has leveraged organized protesters in the past to help him pass legislation. Following the downfall of the 'Stop Online Piracy Act' in 2012, Wyden cited 'massive protests' and a 'grassroots victory for the history books' as the main reason for his success in blocking the bill. Activists in every U.S. state have shouted 'Hands up, don't shoot' during demonstrations opposing the fatal shooting of black 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in August. 'I can't breathe,' another rallying cry,' were the last words uttered by Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in July at the hands of a New York City police officer trying to subdue him. Campus public safety officers attempted to keep some of the protesters outside the building at Portland Community College, drawing threats from one of them.

{"input":"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You might want to go green, but how do you know what you're buying is truly ethical? Greenwash -- the ignoble art of misleading consumers about a product's true green worth -- is on the rise. But thanks to the work of increasingly vigilant regulators, some of the more curious and downright spurious claims are being weeded out. TerraChoice's \"six sins of greenwashing\" include vagueness, irrelevance and outright fibbing. TerraChoice, a Canadian environmental marketing agency, has devised a guide for consumers which they hope goes some way to eradicating greenwash. They've called it \"the six sins of greenwashing.\" Scott McDougall, President and CEO of TerraChoice told CNN: \"The regulatory initiatives in Canada, the U.S., Australia and, I suspect, Europe are rather impenetrable bureaucratic documents, and are not very useful to the average consumer. So we developed it as a tool that would be memorable and useful to consumers.\" The sins include \"Vagueness\" -- terms like 100 percent natural and earth-friendly which don't really mean anything, \"Hidden Trade Off\" -- is a product truly sustainable? And the \"Lesser of Two Evils\" -- trying to make consumers feel green about products that have dubious environmental benefit. Set up in 1995 as part of the Canadian Federal Government's program against greenwash, TerraChoice examines the entire life cycle of a product and the science of environmental claims with a view to awarding Canada's environmental certification mark, the EcoLogo. \"Our position is to help genuine environmental leadership win market share,\" McDougall said. TerraChoice is currently completing a 20-year study of green marketing claims. They have discovered that greenwash is more prevalent when public interest in environmental issues is greater, and that there's been a gradual increase in claims over time. \"It's a kind of a sawtooth curve,\" McDougall said. This rise appears to be a global phenomenon. The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says that complaints about environmental claims \"increased dramatically\" in 2007 -- 561 compared with just 117 the previous year. Car manufacturer Lexus ran into trouble in the UK with its \"High Performance. Low Emissions. Zero Guilt\" advert. The ASA ruled that \"zero guilt\" implied \"little or no damage to the environment.\" British Gas was also found to have misled the public by claiming in a television ad that its green energy was \"carbon zero.\" The regulator agreed with complainants that the phrase implied that no carbon dioxide was produced. In their 2007 report the ASA concluded that; \"claims about carbon emissions and green tariffs were among those most likely to confuse consumers.\" Australia is also clamping down on greenwash. In June 2008, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) demanded that tire manufacturer Goodyear compensate consumers after claiming that their Eagle LS2000 was eco-friendly and cut carbon emissions. The ACCC -- which is also taking Swedish car manufacturer Saab to court over inflated green claims -- has recorded a tenfold increase in complaints since October 2007. So does McDougall think businesses are starting to get the message about greenwash? \"Those sectors under particular scrutiny are educating themselves more quickly about what legitimate green marketing is,\" he said. \"In particular, cleaning formulations and cleaning chemistry. I think there is a great deal of movement towards greening generally.\" But should products which are inherently bad for the environment be allowed to promote their improving green status? Well, Norway doesn't think so. In October 2007 they banned all green references in automobile advertising. In TerraChoice's \"six sins\" many motorized forms of transport would fall into the \"Lesser of Two Evils\" category. McDougall thinks that this is increasingly a problem area. \"It has been suggested to us that some of the claims about fuel efficiency and carbon issues are fundamentally deceiving,\" he said. Inevitably, some products are going to fail the criteria needed to achieve an EcoLogo -- McDougall once had to politely reject a bid wanting organic cigarettes certified -- but he says in most cases that TerraChoice has studied there was not a malicious attempt to mislead. With such a barrage of eco-messages slapped on products these days even McDougall concedes that \"the six sins of greenwashing\" might be too much for consumers to remember when out shopping. So, in a nutshell, what's his advice? \"The most essential guide I can offer consumers is; choose the product that appears to be doing its best to educate you, to offer you information and in precise language.\" Do you think greenwashing is a problem? Do we need more or less regulation? Have your say in the \"sound off\" box below.","output":"Consumers increasingly becoming aware of \"Greenwash\" products .\nCanadian marketing agency TerraChoice outlines the \"six sins of greenwashing\"\nTerraChoice advise people to: \"choose products that appear to educate and inform\""}

{"input":"(CNN) -- Roy Pickler lay on the floor, dripping with sweat, as trainer Bob Harper quipped, \"You look like you got run over by a reindeer.\" Pickler's job as a professional Santa was a constant joke on the latest season of \"The Biggest Loser.\" With his long white beard and protruding stomach, the 63-year-old looked every bit the part he played. By the time he was voted off the show, Pickler had lost 88 pounds. During his elimination interview, he donned a Santa hat and told viewers his toned physique wouldn't stop him from bringing Christmas joy to children. \"The world is going to have to change their acceptance of what Santa looks like,\" Pickler said. \"Santa is a role model, and kids don't want to have a role model that's fat.\" Since 1980, obesity rates among children and adolescents have almost tripled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 12.5 million children age 2 to 19 are obese; that extra weight can lead to serious health problems, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and psychosocial issues such as peer discrimination or poor self-esteem. The epidemic has gotten a lot of attention in the past few years. Everyone from first lady Michelle Obama to Shaquille O'Neal is trying to figure out the best way to inspire kids to get and stay fit. Children learn healthy (or unhealthy) habits from those they admire. And Santa is one of the most recognizable figures in America. For at least a month every year, he appears on billboards, storefronts and TV commercials. Millions of kids stand in line to sit on his comfortably padded lap and whisper secrets in his ear. They write letters to him, sing songs about him and read stories about him. Photos: Santa over the years . We worry about the effect fast-food advertisements have on students in school. With all his free publicity, should Santa still be fat? \"Let's put it this way,\" registered dietician Beth Kitchin said with a laugh. \"I don't think Santa should be skinny.\" There are a lot of other markers to consider in measuring health. Research shows that people can have a higher body mass index and still be healthy, Kitchin said. One can assume Santa is pretty active, wrangling hundreds of elves and nine reindeer every year. And his cheery disposition says a lot about his stress level, which could relate to low blood pressure. Of course, Santa does have a penchant for sugary treats. One fan estimated the big man eats more than 5,000 tons of cookies on Christmas Eve alone. If Santa isn't diabetic, Christmas magic really does exist. A 2009 study published in the British Medical Journal determined that Santa could very well be a \"public health pariah.\" The light-hearted research by Nathan Grills of Monash University in Australia found a correlation between countries that recognize Santa and a high rate of childhood obesity. Santa's weight is a longstanding tradition, said Tom Kliner, founder of Santas Across the Globe and the Fraternity of International Real Bearded Santas. The character originated with St. Nicholas, who lived in Turkey during the fourth century. Nicholas was a wealthy young bishop who started giving away all his gold after his parents died. \"Back in those days, extra weight was a sign of wealth and affluence,\" Kliner said. Hollywood used to have a set of numbers -- waist circumference, face shape, beard length -- that Santas were supposed to adhere to, Kliner said. But around the world, the legendary giver comes in all shapes and sizes. Coca-Cola's Santa, whom many in America try to emulate, is very round: round face, round nose, round stomach. The Santa imitated in Europe is a thinner man with more squared-off features. Kliner said he sees Santa as more of a public figure than a role model. \"I've never seen anybody aspire to become Santa Claus.\" Changing Santa's iconic image would be hard, said Meg Cox, author of \"The Book of New Family Traditions.\" Comfort and security come with seeing the same character year after year. \"We carry these traditions forward from our childhood,\" she said. \"Some of us are pretty emotional about them. And yet I think there's nothing wrong with having a sense of play about it.\" If you want Santa to be skinny, Cox said, make it happen: Tell your kids Santa is tired of eating cookies, and leave an apple out instead. \"Having your own take on Santa might be the ultimate personalized Christmas.\" It's possible our culture is already changing. Santa races are becoming as much of a tradition as candy canes and Christmas lights. Kids are finding active video games under the tree alongside step counters and organic cookbooks for Mom or Dad. 10 healthy gifts that keep giving . Pickler recently called a couple of companies he has contracts with and asked whether they were OK with a trim Santa. \"They both said, 'We want you just the way you are. Your idea of a healthy Santa is the one we want to go with.' \" Since \"The Biggest Loser\" finale, Pickler and his wife, Chris, have spoken to kids across the Midwest about nutrition and exercise. Pickler often walks in to schools dressed as Santa Claus and then takes off his suit, Superman-style, to reveal his new fit self. In an upcoming documentary about Santas titled \"They Wore a Red Suit,\" Pickler implores his colleagues around the country to get fit. \"We cannot use (our role) as an excuse, because it influences kids in the wrong direction,\" he said. Maybe one day, instead of a belly that shakes like a bowl full of jelly, Santa will have a six-pack. Maybe his cheeks will glow not from the cold but because he's consuming the recommended doses of omega-3 fatty acids. Maybe Mrs. Claus will take up gardening. (Granted, that would be hard to do at the North Pole, but surely the elves can build a greenhouse or two.) Eventually, in addition to being a role model for the Christmas spirit, our beloved St. Nick could become a healthy role model for kids. Until then, save some cookies -- Santa Claus is comin' to town.

{"input":"The Earl of Cardigan's mansion has been bought for nearly \u00a312 million after a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle by the Old Etonian aristocrat to prevent the sale of the home on the estate that has been in his family for 900 years. The new owner of Tottenham House is understood to be Conservative Party donor and multi-millionaire property developer Jamie Ritblat. Lord Cardigan, who once said he was 'put on this earth to take care of Savernake and I will never let it go', had fought to keep the 100-room property in his family but was forced to admit defeat earlier this year after an Appeal Court ruling. The 61-year-old Earl had challenged a decision by the trustees of the Savernake estate to sell the dilapidated house and 800 acres near Marlborough, Wiltshire but lost the case.

Tottenham House, which is 200 years old, has been empty since it was used as a prep school in the 1990s . One of the trustees, John Moore, said last night: 'Tottenham House has now been sold. The sale contract is complete.' Mr Moore declined to name the purchaser but Mr Ritblat was reported earlier this year to be negotiating to buy the estate.

Ms Bruce, whose real name is Lady Catherine Brudenell-Bruce, is the daughter of the earl and his first wife, Rosamond, Countess of Cardigan, who died of cancer two years ago. The Savernake estate was given to Lord Cardigan's ancestors by William the Conqueror and was once the site of Wolf Hall, the home of Henry VIII's third wife Jane Seymour that provided the title for Hilary Mantel's award\u2013winning novel. Lord Cardigan is a descendant of the 7th Earl, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. Construction work at Tottenham House has already started and the mansion is expected to be converted into luxury flats. Proceeds from the sale will be shared between the earl and his estranged son, Viscount Savernake, 30.

{"input":"By . Tom Gardner and Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:11 EST, 25 June 2012 . It has been almost two years since Aesha Mohammadzai arrived in America having been brutally ortured in Afghanistan by her husband. He hacked off her nose and ears after she tried to escape their abusive forced marriage leaving her mentally traumatised and horrifically disfigured. With the move to the United States came the promise of reconstructive surgery but it has been delayed as she battles with the psychological torment of her ordeal, and of leaving her homeland for a country where she speaks very little of the language. Touching: Aesha (right) has found a close friend in Miena Arsala, the daughter of the family caring for her . Aesha is expected to undergo six . operations, over the course of the next two years, the first of which . took place on Thursday morning at Walter Reed National Military Medical . Centre in Bethesda, Maryland, CNN reported. It began the process of expanding the skin in her forward for future use in rebuilding her nose. Aesha\u2019s treatment at the military . centre was secured by U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and his office. He said: . \u2018People know we take care of wounded soldiers. \u2018That's kind of an obligation; what . else could you do?' he told CNN. 'But this \u2013 you don't have to do this. It puts a real . human face on our military. How can your heart not go out to Aesha?\u2019 The 22-year-old was accompanied to . the hospital by Mati and Jamila Arsala, a couple who have been caring . for her. They have set up a website called Aesha\u2019s Journey where . messages of support and donations can be posted. Speaking before the operation Aesha . told the news site: \u2018I'm not scared. I'm happy. I suffered a lot in my . life. Now I feel that a light comes into my life.\u2019 The Arsala\u2019s have a 14-year-old daughter, Miena, in whom Aesha has found a close friend. Resilient: Aesha Mohammadzai relaxes at her new home in America where she is building a new life . Miena said of her adopted sister: \u2018I'm pretty sure, once she gets all her surgery, she'll have a lot of guys drooling.\u2019 The family reported that the first operation was a success, but they have apprehensions for what is to come. Aesha will face looking far worse . before she begins to look better, and the surgeries will bring about . severe pain and discomfort. The young girl\u2019s story was first told . by Time magazine, who published a harrowing photograph of her on the . front page, horrifying people around the world. In 2011 she won political asylum in the U.S where she had fled a year earlier. She was given a prosthetic nose, but . full plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was . still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy . surgery required. Those who close to spoke of her . displaying volatile mood swings \u2013 oscillating between violent tantrums . and displaying deep affection to people around her. Beginning the surgery is a sign of just how far Aesha has come. Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. \u2018I really hope at some point she\u2019ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,\u2019 the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Before the surgery was able to begin Aisha was fitted with a prosthetic nose . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman\u00a0 said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: \u2018When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. \u2018By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we\u2019re all happy if she\u2019s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.\u2019 Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'","output":"Aesha Mohammadzai was horrifically disfigured and left for dead for trying to flee abusive forced marriage .\nThe 22-year-old fled to America, aged 18, for reconstructive surgery and won political asylum .\nAesha now battling to put traumatic past behind her and adapt to her new life ."}

A jobless man set himself on fire in Tunisia today in a gesture recalling the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, whose death ignited a revolt that shook the Arab world. Security forces and bystanders in Tunis tried to extinguish the flames before the man was rushed to hospital, witnesses said. 'He is in very critical condition,' a medical source in Mourouj hospital said, but gave no further details. The body of a young Tunisian man, who set himself on fire, is seen at the main street of the capital Tunis . The man doused himself with gasoline and self fire to himself, reviving memories of the self-immolation that helped spark the Arab Spring uprisings . The incident occurred hours before Prime Minister-designate Ali Larayedh was due to seek a confidence vote for his new Islamist-led government from the National Constituent Assembly. The man burned himself outside the municipal theatre in the capital's main Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the focus for protests that toppled President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago. An Interior Ministry official did not name the victim, but said he was aged 27, hailed from the north-western city of Jandouba and had been looking for a job for a long time. Tunisia's unemployment rate stands at about 17 per cent, with graduates forming a large proportion of the jobless total. Several Tunisians have set themselves ablaze in the past two years in protests emulating that of Bouazizi, a street vendor who torched himself on December 17, 2010, in the town of Sidi Bouzid after a policewoman confiscated his fruit cart. Bouazizi's death sparked protests that ended with Ben Ali's overthrow and inspired rebellions elsewhere in the Middle East. The man is believed to be from a poor town in northwestern Tunisia.

The incident happened outside the municipal theatre in the capital's main Habib Bourguiba Avenue . Several Tunisians have set themselves ablaze in the past two years in protests emulating that of Bouazizi . The economic and social problems that fuelled Tunisia's uprising have yet to be solved in a country now deeply polarised between Islamists and their opponents and still awaiting a new constitution to advance a transition from autocracy. The last government, led by Hamadi Jebali, collapsed after the premier's own moderate Islamist Ennahda party rejected his plan for a technocrat cabinet to lead Tunisia to elections. Jebali had proposed this as a way to calm unrest over the assassination on February 6 of secular opposition leader Chokri Belaid by what the authorities say was a group of Salafi Islamist militants, four of whom have been arrested. Larayedh, who was Interior Minister under Jebali, has named independents to take several key portfolios, but failed to bring additional secular parties into the Ennahda-led coalition. The political crisis has delayed talks with the International Monetary Fund on a $1.78billion loan.","output":"Man, believed to be aged 27, stages fiery protest in middle of Tunis .\nRecalls death of Mohamed Bouazizi, which sparked Arab revolts .\nIt occurs hours before new government seeks confidence vote ."}
{"input":"A \u00a315 million British military base will be established in Bahrain marking Britain's clear commitment to a 'sustained presence east of Suez', the Foreign Secretary has said. Philip Hammond told a security summit that bolstering the Royal Navy's presence in the Gulf would allow the UK and its allies in the region to 'tackle the threats we face together'. Britain already has four minehunters permanently based at the Mina Salman Port, but the plans will allow for an increase in the number and size of warships sent to the area. Scroll down for video . \u00a315million development: Britain is to establish a new military base in Bahrain in a Gulf security deal . Under the deal \u2013 described by Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton as 'symbolic and strategically important' \u2013 the port will be expanded and a forward operating base established, with Bahrain paying most of the costs. Although military chiefs are understood to have been working towards the move for around two years, the threat from Islamic State has heightened the focus on Britain's presence in the region. 'To our partners in the Gulf my message is this: Your security concerns are our security concerns,' Mr Hammond said in a speech in Manama, Bahrain. 'So our strategic priority for the Gulf and for the wider region is to build partnerships. Partnerships for security; partnerships for prosperity; partnerships for stability.' He added: 'The expansion of our footprint that this arrangement will now allow means we will have the capability to send more and bigger ships, and to sustain them and their crews in permanent facilities. Philip Hammond said the new base would accommodate ships including Type 45 destroyers, such as the\u00a0HMS Dauntless, above . 'A clear statement of our commitment to our sustained presence east of Suez. 'A reminder of our historic and close relationship with Bahrain and one example of our growing partnership with Gulf allies to tackle the threats we face together. 'And those threats have taken on a new and insidious form: in Benghazi and in Mosul, in Yemen and in Northern Nigeria, we face a common but shadowy enemy: extremists who seek to hijack Islam to impose their own perverted agenda by fear and by the sword; who reject all norms of civilised behaviour; who challenge all structures of established order.' The move was described as 'symbolic' by Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton and reverses a 1960s' decision to withdraw British forces stationed 'east of Suez'. Under the deal, existing facilities at the port will be expanded and a forward operating base established, with Bahrain paying most of the \u00a315 million infrastructure costs. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'This will enable Britain to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability in the Gulf.' Britain already has four minehunters naval ships permanently based at the Mina Salman Port, above . Foreign Secretary\u00a0Philip Hammond (left) said the plans would help 'tackle the threats we face together' while\u00a0Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (right) said more ships will be sent to the Gulf . 'This new base is a permanent expansion of the Royal Navy's footprint and will enable Britain to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability. We will now be based again in the Gulf for the long term.' Mr Hammond signed the deal with Bahrain's foreign minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al-Khalifa. Sheikh Khalid said: 'It reaffirms our joint determination to maintain regional security and stability in the face of challenging circumstances, and gives further strength to our multifaceted partnership. 'Bahrain looks forward to the early implementation of today's arrangement and to continuing to work with the UK and other partners to address threats to regional security.' A string of human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, have criticised the state's human rights record, and anti-arms campaigners protested outside a This is Bahrain conference in Westminster earlier this year, demanding the Government and royal family sever all ties with the regime. General Houghton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's the strategic importance of this. Rather than just being seen as a temporary deployment to an area for a specific operational purpose, this is more symbolic of the fact that Britain does enjoy interests in the stability of this region. The \u00a315million expansion of\u00a0Mina Salman Port means more ships and larger ships will be sent to the Gulf. Above, the HMS Duncan arriving in Cardiff earlier this year . 'And the fact that the Bahraini authorities and government agreed to fund infrastructure within the country to base our maritime capability forward, both is a recognition from their perspective of the quality of the relationship with the United Kingdom, but also of our interest over time in maintaining the stability of this very important area.' Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said: 'Labour supports the Royal Navy having a strong international footprint with the ability to respond quickly to events in a uncertain global environment.

{"input":"(CNN) -- All eyes will be on Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben when Argentina face the Netherlands in the World Cup semifinal in Sao Paulo to discover who will meet Germany in the final. The Dutch will be looking to their mercurial winger to steer them to a second successive World Cup final while Argentina will likely need some Messi magic if they are to reach a first final in 24 years. Both men have been central to the success of their sides so far in the competition earning glowing tributes from team managers past and present. Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella said his midfield maestro was like \"water in the desert\" following his side's 1-0 victory over Belgium in the quarterfinals. \"Each time he gets the ball, it represents hope for all of us and a threatening situation for our opponents,\" Sabella told reporters after the game. \"Regardless of whether he scores goals or not, his influence is decisive. A game has many aspects, apart from goals. \"When you have a player such as Messi, who never, or almost never, loses the ball, it's water in the desert and not just when he scores.\" Dutch praise for Robben has been equally fulsome. Former Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk, who steered the Oranje to the final in 2010, believes Robben may be a better player than the Barcelona midfielder. \"Argentina have got Messi, we've got Robben. And quite frankly, I think the better player is Arjen,\" van Marwijk told Dutch broadcaster NOS TV. \"Four years ago, Arjen was injured just before the start of the tournament in a friendly against Hungary. He was carrying the injury for the whole tournament and was never really 100%. But this year he's been unstoppable.\" Current teammate Dirk Kuyt has also lauded the Bayern Munich star's contribution in Brazil. \"I wouldn't swap Robben for any player in the world,\" Kuyt told FIFA.com earlier in the tournament. \"He is having an amazing World Cup. He's scored goals and created goals, he's so fast and he is a very important player for us.\" Three goals and one assist at the finals attest to Robben's value, though he's also attracted plenty of criticism for his theatrical habit of going down in the penalty area during the tournament. Coach Louis van Gaal will need the 30-year-old to put in a flawless performance if the Dutch are to progress. As Sabella has hinted, two-time champions Argentina are perhaps even more reliant on Messi. The 27-year-old has scored half of Argentina's eight goals in the competition so far. With Angel di Maria ruled out with a thigh injury, strikers Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero (if passed fit) will be relying on Messi more than ever to set them free in front of goal. With three Ballon d'Or awards, three Champions League winners medals and six La Liga titles to his name, Messi would seal his place in football's pantheon if he became the first Argentine since Diego Maradona to lift the trophy. But he's not getting carried away just yet. \"To play a World Cup final with the great atmosphere of the Maracana is something what every player dreams of, but first we have to make sure we get there,\" Messi said, FIFA.com reported. Previous matches between the two sides have produced moments of individual brilliance -- Dennis Bergkamp's exquisite 90th-minute winner in the quarterfinal in 1998 was one of the greatest goals ever seen at a World Cup finals. Twenty-four years earlier it was Johan Cruyff who was strutting his stuff, scoring two goals for the Dutch in a 4-0 win at the 1974 finals hosted and won by Germany. Argentina's only victory against the Netherlands at a World Cup came in the 1978 final -- legendary striker Mario Kempes scoring twice in a 3-1 extra time win at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires. For all the attacking flair on the pitch, the result, in the end, may hinge on the tactical nous of the men in suits standing on the touchline. Since taking over in 2011, Sabella has overseen just four losses in 39 matches. Van Gaal, meanwhile, has seen his side lose just twice in 26 matches during his second stint as the national coach. The 62-year-old, who will take over as manager at English Premier League side Manchester United after the World Cup finishes, has won plaudits for some cunning substitutions during the finals. The introduction of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar late in the game against Mexico helped turn the tide in the European side's favor. The Schalke striker, who came on for Robin van Persie in the 76th minute, laid off the ball for Wesley Sneijder's sumptuous 88th-minute strike before scoring a penalty in injury time as the Oranje snatched a 2-1 victory. Against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals, Van Gaal sent on goalkeeper Tim Krul in the dying seconds of extra time. The bold move worked as the Newcastle United keeper pulled off two saves in the shootout to send the Dutch into the semis and a step closer to a first World Cup title. \"Maybe Louis does have a golden willy,\" Robben cheekily said following the last-gasp win over Mexico in the last 16. On Wednesday we may be one step closer to finding out.","output":"Argentina and the Netherlands contest World Cup semifinal in Sao Paulo .\nDutch winger Arjen Robben has been the Netherlands standout performer in Brazil .\nArgentina relying on Lionel Messi to inspire the two-time winners to final at Maracana .\nDutch looking to reach back-to-back finals; Argentina seek final spot for first time in 24 years ."}
{"input":"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamist militants gained ground in one Malian town on Monday even as government troops stepped up their offensive to wrest control from rebels. Militants have taken control of the central town of Diabaly, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Word of the rebel advance on Monday came as the U.N. Security Council met to discuss the conflict in Mali, where Islamist rebels have been seizing territory for months. World leaders from a number of countries have said they'll send troops or provide logistical support for the fight against Islamist militants in the West African nation. France took the international lead in assisting Mali over the weekend, with military airstrikes targeting rebel training camps and other targets. Officials said France's intervention last week was necessary to stop a rebel takeover of the capital, Bamako. \"Our assessment was that they (the rebels) were actually able to take Bamako. So we decided that what was at stake was the existence of the state of Mali, and beyond Mali was the stability of all west Africa,\" said Gerard Araud, French ambassador to the United Nations. \"We had no other choice to launch this military intervention.\" Read more: France aims to 'eradicate' terrorism in Mali . The United States has promised to help the French effort, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday. That assistance could include logistical and intelligence support. \"I commend France for taking the steps that it has. And what we have promised them is that we will work with them to cooperate with them and to provide whatever assistance we can to try to help them in that effort,\" Panetta told reporters on his plane en route to Portugal. The United States has already started sharing intelligence from satellites and intercepted signals with the French, defense officials said on Monday. In addition, the Pentagon is considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat missions, according to the officials. Drones \"are under consideration,\" the defense officials said, though the military's stash of unmanned aerial vehicles is in heavy demand. Both stressed that these would be surveillance drones and said there are no plans yet to deploy them. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, meanwhile, said the United States is reviewing a number of requests from the French, but that no decisions have been made. The United States, she said, is \"not in the position to support the Malian military directly until we have democratic processes restored by way of an election in Mali.\" It was unclear Monday when France's role in the military offensive would end, and whether there could be consequences beyond Mali's borders. \"There are risks in France and in other countries as well,\" Le Drian told BFM. \"We are extremely vigilant in that regard.\" Malian Foreign Minister Tieman Hubert Coulibaly said Monday that it was unclear how long clashes with Islamist militants would last. \"Clearly, for us it's not just about making them retreat,\" he told BFM. \"It is necessary to chase them out.\" Coulibaly said his country was grateful for France's assistance, which it \"urgently requested.\" And Mali may call on other countries such as the United States for military aid, he said. \"It is a problem which is currently in Mali, but which concerns the whole civilized world. And those who are in action against Mali could attack the rest of the world,\" he told BFM. \"It is a cancer which could have spread if we had not intervened, of course, with the precious aid of France.\" Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali . France has several hundred ground troops in Mali, and nearby West African nations have pledged to send hundreds of troops to join in the fight. Nigeria, which already has a technical team on the ground in Mali, expects to have troops in the country by next week, a presidential spokesman told CNN. He declined to say how many soldiers would be deployed. Officials from the United Kingdom and Germany have said they're considering offering logistical support to the Malian government as it fights insurgents controlling the north. As French fighter jets bombed rebel strongholds over the weekend, both sides of the fight said they were determined to win. \"France's goal is to lead a relentless struggle against terrorist groups, preventing any new offensive of these groups to the south of Mali,\" France's Defense Ministry said in a statement. Islamist rebels in Mali acknowledged Sunday they suffered heavy losses in fights with the country's military and French troops, but they said it wouldn't stop them. \"The war has only started,\" said Sanda Ould Boumama, a spokesman for the al Qaeda-linked rebel group Ansar Dine. \"We expect more casualties.\" He accused the French military of attacking Malians. \"Now the world can see that it's the French who are the real terrorists,\" he said. French and Malian military officials say the assaults are against rebel strongholds, not civilians. Read more: Who is Ansar Dine? On Monday, Amnesty International called on all sides in the conflict to protect civilians. The rights groups also urged the international community to support the deployment of human rights monitors. \"There are real concerns that the fighting might lead to indiscriminate or other unlawful attacks in areas where members of armed Islamist groups and civilians are intermingled,\" Paule Rigaud, Amnesty International's deputy director for Africa, said in a statement. \"The international community has a responsibility to prevent a fresh surge in abuses during this new phase of the conflict. Forces involved in armed attacks should avoid indiscriminate shelling at all costs, and do their utmost to prevent civilian casualties,\" he added. A French colony until 1960, Mali had military rulers for decades until its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the country's largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who wound up in control of a large area as the Tuaregs retreated. The United Nations says amputations, floggings and public executions -- like the July stoning of a couple who had reportedly had an affair -- became common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law in banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines. A recent video posted online purports to show Islamic extremists from the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa cutting off the hand of a thief and flogging another man, accused of having sexual relations with a girl with \"mental deficiencies.\" In the video, the supposed crimes of the men are read aloud before the punishments are carried out. A small crowd, including children, cheer. Already, the armed groups' activity and a pervasive drought have displaced hundreds of thousands of Malians. And the Islamists' movement southward has raised concerns among leaders in West Africa and elsewhere, some of them calling for swift and decisive military intervention in support of Mali's government, based in Bamako. The U.N. Security Council last month authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in the country. Members of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, pledged thousands of troops, and the Security Council has urged other nations to contribute forces as well. The Security Council met Monday to receive an update on Mali. Following that meeting, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, said there may be a need for a new Security Council resolution. The United Nations said preparations are under way for a U.N. multidisciplinary team to go to Bamako soon. Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo, Senegal and Benin are among the countries that have pledged to send troops, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters Monday. Mali's northern neighbor, Algeria, will close its border with Mali, Algeria's state news agency, Algeria Press Service reported. A spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry said the country's leaders were considering offering medical, logistical and humanitarian aid to Mali. Two British military transport aircraft have been assigned to help with the French troop deployment, but no British forces will be in a combat role, said Mark Simmonds, minister for Africa for the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office. \"The ferocity and fanaticism of the extremists in northern Mali must be not be allowed to sweep unchecked into the country's capital,\" Simmonds told British lawmakers Monday. \"France, which has an historic relationship with Mali, is quite rightly in the lead. In the coming days, we will be focused on the regional and international diplomacy we must achieve to check this emerging threat.\" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Dana Ford, Chris Lawrence, Dheepthi Namasivayam, Vladimir Duthiers, Saskya Vandoorne and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this report.","output":"NEW: Defense officials: U.S. has already started sharing intelligence with the French .\nNEW: \"We had no other choice,\" says the French ambassador to the United Nations .\nNEW: The U.N.

{"input":"(CNN) -- Her name was Alice Guy-Blache, and you've probably never heard of her. That's understandable. Her heyday was a century ago. She was French and spent only a few years in the United States. Her work -- what little of it has survived -- generally lives on in museum collections. But perhaps you should find out who she is. For Guy-Blache, who died in 1968, was a pioneer in the film industry. She was the first female director. She was perhaps the first to create a narrative film. She was an innovator in storytelling and in business. Pamela Green is trying to raise her profile. Green and Jarik van Sluijs, her colleague at the Los Angeles design firm PIC, have created a Kickstarter campaign to secure funding for a documentary on Guy-Blache. The work-in-progress, called \"Be Natural\" -- after a common Guy-Blache acting instruction -- is attempting to raise $200,000. Green was inspired by a special about female pioneers in cinema, which also included Mary Pickford and Lois Weber. \"Alice stuck with me,\" says Green. \"And when it was over, I was surprised that I didn't hear (more) about her.\" Given her contributions to motion pictures, you'd think Guy-Blache would have attracted more notice. She was present practically at the creation of the industry, joining French businessman Leon Gaumont -- whose company was one of the first movie producers -- as a secretary in 1894. Two years later, when she was just 23, she helmed a one-reel short, \"La Fee aux Choux\" (\"The Cabbage Fairy\"). She started her own company, Solax Films, in 1910, and set up a state-of-the-art studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, two years later -- the first woman to own a studio. She oversaw more than 1,000 films, many noted for their pioneering use of light, composition and even synchronized sound. \"She had a very important place in film history,\" says Thomas J. Slater, a film scholar at Indiana University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the silent era. \"She was more than just a filmmaker -- she also knew how to organize a production company and get her work out there.\" Slater suspects that a combination of factors caused Guy-Blache to fall into anonymity. The business moved to Hollywood; Guy-Blache never really made the move. At the same time, her husband, Herbert Blache, took control of Solax, and she eventually returned to France and divorced him. And there was also the matter of her sex. Even 100 years later, women struggle for positions of power in Hollywood -- particularly behind the camera. It was big news three years ago when Kathryn Bigelow won best director for \"The Hurt Locker,\" only the fourth woman to even be nominated in that category. It was a different atmosphere in the teens and early '20s, says Slater. At the time a number of women were screenwriters and directors. But once the business started consolidating, women's creative positions \"dropped off drastically,\" he says. Even Weber, one of the most accomplished directors of the teens, was largely forgotten. Indeed, from the beginning of the sound era in 1927 until the 1970s, about the only female directors of note in Hollywood were Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino. In the case of Guy-Blache, says Green, \"maybe her experience and her accomplishments were something that worked a little bit against her. They didn't want people who knew too much. She kind of encompassed that.\" Though the film will make use of old stills and Guy-Blache's work, Green and van Sluijs want it to have a modern look, where -- thanks to computer effects -- the viewer will practically feel inside the frame. The two have the experience: as established creative directors, they've produced sequences for such films as \"The Cabin in the Woods,\" \"42\" and \"The Muppets.\" The trailer for \"Be Natural\" invites you into another time. A number of film luminaries have gotten behind \"Be Natural's\" Kickstarter campaign, including Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, but the campaign is still well short of its financial goal. (An FAQ explains that despite some stars' participation, \"this is not the type of project that gets traditional Hollywood funding, nor is it the type of film that qualifies for educational grants.\") Green is hopeful they'll make it across the finish line. After all, just because she's little known doesn't mean that Alice Guy-Blache is any less inspirational, says Green. \"There's an Alice in all of us,\" she says. \"This is a piece of history, but that's not the story. The story is about a woman who saw the opportunity in a time where she had nothing but obstacles, and she went and did it. The message is, if you have a dream, and you visualize it, you can do it.\"","output":"Alice Guy-Blache was pioneering female director .\nGuy-Blache had her own studio in silent era, directed hundreds of films .\nShe's now the subject of a Kickstarter campaign to tell her story ."}

Brendan Quinn, 38, was manager of the \u00a310,000 a week Causeway Retreat on Osea Island, Malden, Essex, which boasted Take That\u2019s Mark Owen and the late Amy Winehouse as patients. Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like \u201810 Years Younger\u2019 and \u2018How To Look Good Naked,\u2019 killed herself in January 2010 after she was treated on the island. She had self-harmed and made an attempt on her own life the day before she was told by staff to leave the retreat. At an inquest into her death, her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, criticised the clinic, saying: \u2018There were so many opportunities at this point to help her and they were not taken.\u2019 Advertising material for the Causeway Retreat named Quinn as one of Britain\u2019s 250 best private doctors, even though he was not qualified, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Quinn was the boss and a major shareholder of the facility\u2019s operator, Twenty 7 Management, which rented the Edwardian manor. The Causeway, which charged a minimum \u00a35,000 per week, also treated\u00a0actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers and members of some of Britain\u2019s wealthiest families. It\u00a0was never registered as an independent hospital with watchdog the Care Quality Commission. But patients with mental health problems were admitted to the unlicensed facility, the hearing was told. The clinic did not have a doctor on site at all times and patients were adequately supervised. Quinn also failed to tell employees they were working illegally in an unlicensed hospital. While he was in charge medication was administered by unqualified staff without valid prescriptions and drugs were stored in a suitcase in an unlocked room. Tragic:\u00a0Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like \u201810 Years Younger\u2019 and \u2018How To Look Good Naked,\u2019 killed herself in January 2010 after she was treated on the island . NMC panel chairman James Spencer told him: \u2018Your acts and omissions could foreseeably have caused significant harm to patients. \u2018You consistently placed your own commercial needs above those of highly vulnerable patients. \u2018You not only deceived the public as to your correct qualifications, by holding yourself out as a doctor, you also deceived those involved in ensuring correct registration of services as to the exact nature of the services provided at the Causeway.\u2019 The hearing into Quinn\u2019s management of the Causeway began in 2012 and has been adjourned at least five times, having run for more than 90 days, costing the taxpayer more than \u00a3300,000. Announcing the decision to strike Quinn off Mr Spencer said there was no doubt his conduct had put patients at \u2018unwarranted risk of harm\u2019. He told Quinn: \u2018You allowed particularly vulnerable patients to be admitted into an unregistered and unsafe environment. 'You failed to ensure that the Causeway was capable of providing adequate and appropriate care to patients through your failure to establish and maintain appropriate arrangements for the management of medication and your failure to ensure adequate staffing levels. \u2018Throughout the period of the charges, you demonstrated a flagrant disregard for patient safety. \u2018The panel was also satisfied that your misconduct brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute.\u2019 He added: \u2018In all the circumstances the panel concluded that your misconduct was fundamentally incompatible with your ongoing registration.

Additionally, it considered that the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the profession, and the NMC as a regulatory body, would be significantly undermined were a striking off order not imposed in your case.\u2019 Quinn, of Lewes, East Sussex, denied all the allegations against him, insisting former staff members had cooked up elaborate stories to ruin his reputation. He said: \u2018They have been determined to absolutely destroy my career and indeed they\u2019ve done an absolutely superb job. \u2018They have come here and they have given evidence and they\u2019ve had regular meetings outside this process.\u2019 He claimed he had also been bombarded with anonymous text messages from pay-as-you go phones threatening him and his family. But the panel dismissed Quinn\u2019s claims of an elaborate conspiracy saying it \u2018lacks credibility\u2019. Earlier Krystal Whymet for the NMC said: \u2018Quinn allowed for clients to be admitted to Causeway who were suffering from mental health matters, even when warned by the CSCI (Commission for Social Care Inspection) that this was not appropriate. \u2018He did not ensure that the clients suffering from mental health matters were adequately assessed of supervised.

Claims that he instructed a staff member to remove a client\u2019s prosthetic leg to stop him wandering about were also found not proved. He was also cleared of allegations that clients had access to kitchen knives and ropes and that boats bringing clients to the island were not equipped with enough life jackets.

{"input":"A planet which really does twinkle like a diamond in the sky has been discovered by scientists - its surface is littered with the precious stones. The planet - called 55 Cancri e - has a radius double the size of Earth\u2019s, and weighs eight times more. Whilst Earth\u2019s surface is covered in water and granite, the new planet is thought to be covered in diamonds and graphite. An artist's impression of the 'diamond planet' twice the size of Earth . The planet-hosting star 55 Cancri in the constellation of Cancer. The star is visible to the naked eye, although researchers say it is easier to find through binoculars. For the exact location, see the sky map below. A new study estimates that at least a third of the planet\u2019s mass - the equivalent of the weight of three Earths - could be diamond. This is the first time astronomers have identified a likely diamond planet around a sun-like star and unearthed its chemical make-up. 'This is our first glimpse of a rocky world with a fundamentally different chemistry from Earth,' said lead researcher Nikku Madhusudhan. 'The surface of this planet is likely covered in graphite and diamond rather than water and granite.' The diamond planet orbits at hyper speed - its year lasts just 18 hours, in contrast to Earth\u2019s 365 days. But with a blazingly hot temperature of about 3,900F, researchers say it will not live on. It one of five planets orbiting a sun-like star, 55 Cancri, that is located 40 light years from Earth yet visible to the naked eye in the constellation of Cancer. The planet was first observed orbiting its star last year, allowing astronomers to measure its radius for the first time. This new information, combined with the most recent estimate of its mass, allowed Madhusudhan and colleagues to determine its chemical make-up. Star map showing the planet-hosting star 55 Cancri in the constellation of Cancer. The star is visible to the naked eye, though better through binoculars. Research suggests the planet has no water at all, and appears to be composed mainly of carbon (as graphite and diamond), iron, silicon carbide, and, possibly, some silicates. 'By contrast, Earth\u2019s interior is rich in oxygen, but extremely poor in carbon - less than a part in thousand by mass,' says co-author and Yale geophysicist Kanani Lee. The identification of a carbon-rich super-Earth means that distant rocky planets can no longer be assumed to have compositions similar to that of Earth. David Spergel, professor of astronomy and chair of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University, said: 'This \u2018diamond-rich super-Earth\u2019 is likely just one example of the rich sets of discoveries that await us as we begin to explore planets around nearby stars.' The paper reporting the findings has been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.","output":"55 Cancrie e visible with the naked eye from Earth .\nThe planet's surface is believe to be covered in diamonds and graphite ."}
{"input":"(CNN) -- The outrage came hard and fast after a 3-year-old girl badly scarred and wearing an eye patch because of a pit bull attack was apparently asked to leave a KFC restaurant because her appearance upset other customers. After social media users opened fire on the restaurant, calling for a boycott, the apology from the chain came quickly too. The company said it will donate $30,000 to assist with the girl's medical bills. \"The entire KFC family is behind Victoria,\" company spokesman Rick Maynard said. 'Her face is disrupting our customers' Victoria Wilcher was mauled by three pit bulls a few months ago, causing her to need regular medical treatment. After a doctor's visit last week, grandmother Kelly Mullins took the child to a KFC in Jackson, Mississippi. \"I ordered a large sweet tea and her some mashed potatoes and gravy because she was hungry,\" Mullins told CNN affiliate WAPT. \"She was on a feeding tube at the time, but I figured she could just swallow (the potatoes). They just told us, they said, 'We have to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers.' (Victoria) understood exactly what they said.\" Victoria cried all the way home, Mullins said. \"She's got a lot of surgeries to go through and she won't even look in the mirror anymore,\" Mullins told WAPT. \"When we go to a store, she doesn't even want to get out (of the car). She's 3 years old and she's embarrassed about what she looks like. She's embarrassed and I hate it because she shouldn't be. It ain't her fault.\" Anger online . Victoria's family recounted the incident in a Facebook page set up to raise money for her medical expenses. \"Does this face look scary to you?\" the family posted on the Victoria's Victories Facebook page. \"I personally will never step foot in another KFC again and will be personally writing the CEO.\" The anger spread. \"As soon as we were notified of this report Friday, we immediately began an investigation, as this kind of hurtful and disrespectful action would not be tolerated by KFC,\" the company said. \"Regardless of the outcome of our investigation, we have apologized to Victoria's family and are committed to assisting them.\" A horrible attack . Authorities said Victoria was attacked in April while visiting her grandfather, from whom Kelly Mullins is divorced. One of the dogs ripped open the front door and two other dogs dragged her into the backyard, WAPT reported. The dogs bit the girl all over, but especially on the face. She has severe facial scars and lost sight in her right eye and the ability to move the right side of her face, Mullins told WAPT. She wears an eye patch with a cartoon character on it. The three dogs that attacked Victoria were killed. The grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend were arrested on child endangerment charges, WAPT reported. Meanwhile, the Facebook page got lots of attention, with almost 49,000 \"likes\" by early Monday morning.","output":"Victoria Wilcher was attacked by three pit bulls in April .\nLast week her grandmother took her to a KFC in Jackson, Mississippi .\nA restaurant employee said the girl's scars scared other customers, the grandmother said .\nKFC is investigating and will donate $30,000 to Victoria's treatment ."}

The US space agency plans to send seeds to the moon in 2015 in sealed canisters containing everything that is needed for the seedlings to thrive. As well as ten seeds each of basil and turnips, there will also be around 100 seeds of Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard. The US Space Agency are to send a batch of seedlings to the moon in sealed canisters and will monitor their growth which could indicate whether human beings would survive in space . On landing, a trigger will release a small reservoir of water inside the canister and a team on Earth will monitor how the seeds germinate when exposed to lunar gravity and radiation. A group of scientists, students and volunteers - known as the Lunar Plant Growth Habitat team - are behind the project which will see the seedlings photographed at intervals to compare with those planted on earth. The air in the sealed containers should be adequate for more than 5 days of growth. A Nasa spokesman said: \u2018They can test the lunar environment for us, acting as a canary in a coal mine. 'If we send plants and they thrive, then humans probably can.' Thriving plants need the same ingredients for life as humans \u2013 food, water and air \u2013 and also provide psychological comfort for people, demonstrated by the popular greenhouses in Antarctica and the International Space Station. The seeds will be sent to the moon in the Moon Express Lander (illustrated here by computer generation) in 2015 . Nasa plans on sending the seedlings to the moon by hitching a lift on a commercial spacecraft called the Moon Express lander, which is competing to win Google\u2019s Lunar X-Prize in 2015. Scientists are currently constructing a unit to study the germination of the plants, which will have a mass of just one kilogram and will be deposited on the moon. Water will be added to the seeds in the module after landing and their growth will be monitored for five to 10 days and compared to Earth-based control seedlings. Arabidopsis (pictured), basil and turnip seeds will be sent to the moon in containers containing all the elements needed for the plants to grow on earth . Seeds will include Arabidopsis, basil, and turnips and Nasa says the experiment will be the first of its kind on another world and \u2018an important first step in the utilisation of plants for human life support\u2019. Follow-up experiments will improve the technology in the growth module and allow for more extensive plant experiments, the organisation said. Survival for 14 days demonstrates plants can sprout in the moon\u2019s radiation environment but survival to 60 days demonstrates that sexual reproduction (meiosis) can occur in a lunar environment. Survival to 180 days shows effects of radiation on dominant and recessive genetic traits and afterwards, the experiment may run for months through multiple generations, increasing science return. There has been a lot of research on plant growth in microgravity, on space shuttles and in the International Space Station. But the surface of the moon is the only location in which the effects of both lunar gravity and lunar radiation on plant growth can be studied.","output":"US space agency to send basil and turnip seeds among others to the moon .\nSeedlings will be photographed at intervals to compare to those on earth .\nExperts believe if plants thrive in space then humans 'probably can' too ."}
{"input":"The mother of a missing 14-month-old boy told police she abandoned him on a porch - then days later led police to his  his viciously beaten body that had been stuffed inside a backpack and dumped in an Ohio river, a court has heard. When Cameron Beckford was reported missing last Friday by his father, Dainesha Stevens, 24, claimed she left the toddler on a porch because she could no longer care for him. Five days later, she led police to the youngster's mangled body in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, authorities say. Stevens and her son were staying with  a childhood friend, Kurt Flood, at his home in Columbus, after she fled the home of the boy's father in Maryland two weeks ago. No one has yet been charged in the boy's death, though Stevens was called in front a judge after she was charged with failing to protect her son from child abuse. A court heard that Cameron was horrifically beaten between December 21 and 23 - a week before his body was found. Scroll down for video . Missing: Authorities continue to search for 14-month-old Cameron Beckford, who they warn may be already dead . Mother: Dainesha Stevens, pictured during a court appearance on Wednesday, admitted she and a male acquaintance left the boy, Cameron Beckford, on Friday night because they could no longer care for him . Stevens has now been charged with failing to protect her son 'by allowing an individual to violently spank him numerous times on several occasions.' Flood, also 24, is being held in the county jail on an unrelated misdemeanor and a probation violation stemming from a felony weapons charge. Stevens made up a story about leaving the boy on a porch and says that was her way of asking for help, said her attorney, Mark Collins. During a court appearance on Wednesday, he said: 'There's reasons why she said what she said, but she's trying to do the right thing and that's what she did by helping yesterday and today.' Collins said Stevens came to the Columbus area December 15 after calling police in Maryland for help, then receiving a bus pass from the local protective services agency. Frederick police spokesman Lt. Clark Pennington said a domestic dispute preceded Stevens' departure, however there were no details about what happened. 'I know that they had, like, an argument on the 14th and that's why we think she went to Ohio on the 15th,' he said. Frederick police previously said the father of Cameron and Steven's six-year-old daughter Cheyene, Shawn Beckford, called police on Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December. Collins said he didn't know the details of what happened in Maryland. Kurt Flood (left) let Stevens (recent mugshot right) stay at his house after she fled Germantown, Maryland, following a domestic abuse allegation . Stevens' attorney Mark Collins said during her first court appearance Wednesday that she lied about abandoning her son on a porch as a cry for help . The father of Stevens' two children, Cameron and Cheyenne, six, reported them missing after she had fled to Columbus, Ohio, mid-December . Stevens on Monday reported that Cheyenne had been taken to an unknown location by a friend, and investigators determined the toddler was missing while questioning the woman, police said. 'But I haven't seen her since Christmas Eve,' Stevens of Cheyenne in a 911 call obtained by\u00a0Fox 28. 'And I've been trying to get her back from the people, and they won't tell me any information about her. They won't even try to bring her back to me.' Cheyenne later was found at a home on the city's west side and is in good condition, authorities said. She has been turned over to Franklin County Children Services. Stevens was staying with a male friend she knew as a teenager in Maryland, Collins said. That man is being held on misdemeanor warrants unrelated to the toddler's disappearance. 'It's our goal to keep that man in custody pending further investigation by the police,' said Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien. Stevens pointed police to the creek, Collins confirmed Wednesday without providing details. The 24-year-old mother led police to Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, where Cameron's body was found stuffed in a back pack . A court heard on Wednesday that the child's body had been in the water for days . Police said Stevens had legal custody of both children. A missing-child alert said the toddler was wearing a puffy black coat, gray pants, black and red boots and a gray elephant hat. Police said he's black with brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle. A woman who answered the phone at a house believed to be the father's residence said he wasn't home. She said Beckford was her son. She apologetically declined to answer more questions and would not give her name. She also refused to open the door to the apartment, located in a densely populated neighborhood in the city, about 40 miles west of Baltimore. Criminal complaints obtained by Fox28 say three days before Christmas Cameron was 'violently spanked repeatedly' in a Columbus home - and his mother did not step in to save him. The complaints also said the spanking 'caused layers of skin to be removed from the child buttocks.' Court documents obtained by the station says Cameron's body was moved December 27 with Steven's permission for '[impairing] its availability as evidence.' She has been placed on suicide watch while in custody. Police are holding her and Flood in a bid to establish more about the investigation.

He's called Pippa Middleton ugly, Adele fat and Lana del Rey fake, and now Karl Lagerfeld has unleashed his acid tongue on pretty much anyone who has had cosmetic surgery in attempt to conceal the aging process. 'The worst are the lip operations,' he rants to Zeit Online. 'They look like they flew through the windscreen during a car accident and were patched up badly afterwards.' The 88-year-old fashion designer - who is perhaps as famous for his cutting remarks as he is for his work at the helm of Chanel - added that he knows people he doesn't even 'recognize' after they've undergone lip surgery. Outspoken: Eighty-eight-year-old Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld (pictured last week in London) has slammed those who go under the knife in order to look younger . 'Nothing makes you look older than attempting to look young,' he continues. And Mr Lagerfeld's contempt for the 'old' appears to extend much further than just those who try to cheat the clock by going under the knife. 'I don't know anyone from my generation. I find those people terrible', he admits, favoring the company of much younger people instead. Car crash? Mr Lagerfeld took particular issue with lip surgery, likening people who have had it (such as Jocelyn Wildenstein, 74, pictured) with victims of car accidents who have 'flown through the windscreen' Fans: Other notable sporters of the trout pout include Courtney Stodden (right) and actress Lindsay Lohan (left) who was once regularly seen on the arm of Mr Lagerfeld, but before she allegedly started having lip injections . And he is true to his word when it comes to hanging out with a younger crowd.

But even his favorite supermodel, Miss Delevingne, hasn't escaped Mr Lagerfeld's sharp tongue of late. Speaking to The Guardian last month, he revealed that he did not consider the bushy-browed Brit to be 'a standout beauty' - but rather a model with 'strange' proportions.

Mr Lagerfeld, who has enjoyed a 67 year career in the fashion industry, concludes his interview with Zeit by offering a little insight as to the very beginnings of his age-related preferences. 'As a child I only had one wish: to be grown up,' he remarks. 'I didn't play with other children, I thought they were dreadful.

Another 150 were injured and an unknown number of people were missing. No other information was available about the Oklahoma mother who died while huddling over her child. Michelann Ooten, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, said the town enlisted firefighters from surrounding areas who went house-to-house in a 20-block area, sifting through rubble and searching for survivors. \"It looks like a war zone,\" she said. \"Some homes have fallen in, some homes have lost roofs and some are now just slabs.\" Freelance journalist Mike Priest went to a heavy-hit neighborhood in Picher on Sunday, surveying an area where almost all the houses were leveled. All the residents had evacuated leaving behind, cars, clothes and even their pets, Priest said. \"As you can see some people's pets have been left behind and they are fighting over some food,\" he said, shooting footage of the scene. \"Just total devastation. Houses wiped all the way down to the foundation. You can see what used to be a house in the driveway. The storm was incredibly, incredibly strong right through here.\" CNN's Lee Garen, Susan Candiotti and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","output":"15 dead in Missouri, 1 killed in Georgia, six in Oklahoma, officials say .\nStates of emergency declared in Oklahoma, Georgia counties .\nStorm system struck Midwest, then continued into the South .\nPresident Bush has pledged federal support, has talked to states' governors ."}
{"input":"(CNN) -- Washington isn't listening. The disconnect between the American people and the agenda being advanced in Washington is growing by the day. When Americans have spoken up, their voices have fallen on deaf ears. Political expedience and partisan allegiances have repeatedly trumped the priorities of the American people. Americans wanted jobs, but instead Washington passed a \"stimulus\" that has failed to keep unemployment below 8 percent as promised -- while producing countless instances of government waste. Americans wanted lower health care costs, but instead Washington passed a health care law that will actually increase costs and hurt our economy. Americans want common-sense fiscal discipline, but Washington continues to spend money we don't have and pile debt on future generations. The current approach in Washington is failing the American people, who deserve a Congress and a government that puts their priorities and everyday concerns first. It's not enough, however, for Republicans to simply state our principled opposition to the current agenda. We must also offer the American people a clear set of solutions they can expect us to fight for, a project that House Republican Leader John Boehner has tasked me to lead. Shortly after beginning this important work, we realized that distrust in government runs too deep to simply hand down a policy plan from Washington. More than just new policy, we also need to change the way Washington sets its policy. That notion is the driving force behind America Speaking Out, an unprecedented initiative designed to engage the public in a discussion of your priorities for America. Read more about the GOP's plan . Beginning next week, House Republicans will be setting out across the country to hold America Speaking Out town halls, where we will seek your input on creating a new policy agenda. At the same time, we will be using all the technological tools available to us, such as phone apps and telephone town halls, to listen to the priorities of the American people. This effort includes a new interactive website -- AmericaSpeakingOut.com -- that will allow anyone, regardless of party, to submit what he or she believes should be a part of this new plan. We have developed this site to be the home for an online conversation between members of Congress and those they are elected to represent. These ideas and exchanges will serve as the building blocks for the governing agenda we will present to the American people later this year. Of course, this will be a Republican agenda, so this project is designed to take core common-sense, conservative principles -- whether it's building a smaller, more accountable government, economic freedom and lower taxes, or providing for a strong national defense -- and discuss how they can be applied to America's priorities. Rather than a listening tour, we are seeking a robust debate about the challenges we face and the solutions that should be pursued. Leadership is about laying out clear solutions to the challenges we face, just as we have offered positive alternatives to Democratic policies with which we disagree. But leadership today also requires a humility that appreciates that Americans are really in charge of Congress. America Speaking Out recognizes that the wisdom and will of the American people are the only things strong enough to change the course our nation is on. Building a new agenda for our nation starts today, and we hope all Americans will join us in the process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin McCarthy.","output":"Rep. Kevin McCarthy says Washington hasn't been listening to what Americans want .\nHe says people wanted lower health care costs, not a costly new entitlement .\nPeople wanted more jobs, not a stimulus that has failed to keep unemployment down, he says .\nMcCarthy says the GOP is asking Americans for ideas for a new policy agenda ."}
{"input":"Britain\u2019s house price boom is showing no sign of slowing \u2013 after fresh figures released today revealed the cost of buying a house has increased 11.7 per cent over the past year. The average cost of a house in the UK hit a new high of \u00a3274,000 in August, as increases in London and the South East fuelled a nationwide jump in prices. In the capital property prices jumped by 19.6 per cent \u2013 with the average home now worth \u00a3514,000. Scroll down for video . London properties continue to pull away from the rest of the country, according to this morning's ONS figures . The average cost of a home in London is now almost twice as much as elsewhere in the country . The increasing cost of housing is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder. In August, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12.9 per cent higher on average than the same time last year. The average price for properties bought by first-time buyers increased was \u00a3210,000. England continued to see the largest house price growth across the UK \u2013 with properties going up in value by 12.2 per cent in the year to August. The cost of buying a home in Wales was up 4.7 per cent, while in Scotland prices jumped 6.7 per cent. Northern Ireland also enjoyed strong house price growth \u2013 with property values up 9.6 per cent over the year. England\u2019s housing boom was driven by the capital \u2013 but also by East Anglia and the wider South East. In the areas around London prices jumped 12.3 per cent, while \u2018the East\u2019 region saw the cost of properties increase by 11.6 per cent. Excluding London and the South East, UK house prices increased by 7.8 per cent in the 12 months to August 2014. The North East has the lowest average house price at \u00a3154,000. London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of \u00a3274,000. Excluding London and the South East, the average house price across the country was \u00a3208,000. House prices are continuing to soar across the country - driven by runaway property costs in London and the South East . After a big drop in price rises during 2009 prices have carried on booming in the property market . Labour this morning raised concerns that soaring prices were making it increasingly leaving workers behind. Catherine McKinnell, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury Minister, said: 'Total pay is rising at just 0.6 per cent. 'Working people whose real wages have fallen by \u00a31,600 a year since 2010 face a further hit if the Tories win the election and cut tax credits again.' A rise in interest rates could be delayed until the middle of next year after inflation dropped to a five-year low. Cheaper travel, restaurants, books and gadgets like tablets and laptops meant the CPI rate of inflation was just 1.2 per cent in September, well below the Bank of England's target of 2 per cent, and the lowestr since September 2009. Low inflation removes any immediate pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates amid the continuing uncertain recovery in the wider economy. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show the CPI rate of inflation has fallen to just 1.2 per cent . The Office for National Statistics said the fall from 1.5 per cent in August had been sharper than expected. For the fifth month in a row food bills fell, down by 1.4 per cent year-on-year, the steepest drop since June 2002. It is the longest sustained period of flat or falling food prices since the end of 2004. Low inflation is good news for millions of families who have been struggling to cope with rising bills. Latest figures show that average wages are rising by 0.7 per cent year-on-year, so even with 1.2 per cent inflation incomes are being outstripped by rising prices. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'It's good news that inflation remains low. Our long-term economic plan is delivering more financial security and stability for families. 'Today's inflation figures mean a big real-terms increase in the state pension next year - helping people who've worked hard all their lives.' The Bank of England targets inflation at 2 per cent but it has now been below this level for nine months in a row. With inflation falling, the Bank will be reluctant to put up interest rates amid fears it could stifle the recovery. Cheaper transport and computer prices and lower bills in restaurants were the biggest factors for the lower rate of inflation, the ONS said . Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'With oil and petrol prices falling, import costs dropping due to the exchange rate, supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low, it's hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months,. 'This more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, and could even add to calls for policy-makers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months. 'While a few months ago, the likelihood was growing that the Bank might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year, the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer, after the general election.' ING Bank economist James Knightley said: 'With inflation substantially below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target and the eurozone growth outlook appearing to deteriorate, there is little pressure to tighten monetary policy any time soon. 'This means our February prediction for the first rate hike may be a little early.'

{"input":"Bulgaria's famous emerald green cat has finally reappeared after vanishing from the streets of Varna three days ago. The ludicrously-coloured moggy, who has become an internet sensation, was spotted prowling through the popular seaside resort to the relief of worried locals. The cat was also seen cosying up to a ginger companion - believed to be her son. Scroll down for video . Return:\u00a0Bulgaria's green cat has finally reappeared after vanishing from the streets of Varna three days ago . The feline was not seen for three\u00a0days, raising fears that she has been abducted as a result of her new found fame. Some residents of the popular tourist destination insisted that rain had washed the animal's colour away and say a similar-looking green cat was seen last year. Although the unusual colour was initially thought to have been caused by an act of cruelty, reports emerged the green shine was from paint at the nearby construction yard where she sleeps. It is hoped that the stand-out nature of the feline won't influence owners to paint their own cats. Ginger companion:\u00a0The cat was pictured cosying up to another ginger moggy - believed to be her son . Theory: It is thought the cat's coat is dyed green by paint she rubs against in a construction yard where she sleeps . The RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'. Some locals were quoted as saying they believe the stray cat was becoming greener each day, fuelling the idea that someone was painting it. An earlier video, which appeared on YouTube, shows the mysterious moggy playing with the same ginger cat it was recently spotted with. Varna is a popular tourist destination as it is the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.

{"input":"By . Sam Peters . Cricket is once again facing up to the spectre of corruption with the recent one-day international series between the West Indies and Pakistan set to be investigated over allegations of wrongdoing. Suspicious betting patterns were identified during the low-profile five-match series, which concluded on Thursday, while unusually slow run-rates during certain overs followed by bursts of high scoring have \u2018set alarm bells ringing\u2019, according to industry experts. Concerns have been raised, in particular, around the tied third match of the series played in St\u00a0Lucia a week ago on Friday, as well as the final game, which resulted in a last-ball win for Pakistan on Thursday. Investigation: Pakistan celebrate winning the five-match series . Danish Kaneria: Pakistan leg-spinner banned for life by ECB in June 2012. Found guilty of 'pressurising' Mervyn Westfield into accepting cash to concede a number of runs in game against Durham . Mervyn Westfield: Essex bowler banned from first-class cricket until 2017. Jailed for four months for spot-fixing in a one-day game against Durham in 2009. Can play club cricket next year . The second ODI, which saw Pakistan fail to score a run off the bat in the first five overs after being set 233 to win, will also be looked at. One betting website reported unusually large sums of money \u2014 said to run into several millions of pounds \u2014 being wagered between innings on a tied result during the third ODI after the West Indies were set 230 to win from 50 overs. Pakistan appeared to be cruising to victory, with their opponents still requiring 45 off the last 21 balls and only three wickets left. But with the tail-enders scoring at more than four times the rate of most of their team-mates, West Indies scraped the unlikeliest of ties. Field placings for the final over, when No\u00a011 Jason Holder and fellow tail-ender Kemar Roach crashed 14 off six balls from Wahab Riaz, will be scrutinised by officers of the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), along with a failed run-out bid off the last delivery. Baffling: The field placings of captain Misbah (left) have been called into question . Television commentator Ian Bishop, the former West Indies fast bowler, said at the time: \u2018There is no way, no way, that you can convince me, whatever happens to this last ball, that Wahab Riaz and Misbah ul Haq have had this field right to the length they have been trying to execute. There is no one who can convince me of that. Totally wrong.\u2019 The fifth ODI, which saw Pakistan win by four wickets off the final ball, is also to be scrutinised. ACSU officers will also analyse patterns on spread-betting sites around the first 18 balls of the West Indies innings when only one run was scored. \u2018There were suspicious betting patterns on a betting exchange,\u2019 said betting expert Ed Hawkins, the author of Bookie, Gambler, Fixer, Spy. \u2018A suspicious pattern, simply, is a flood of money wagered on an outcome just before it happens. There were some noticeable examples of this during the West Indies-Pakistan series. In the tied match, a weight of cash arrived on the tie market before Pakistan\u2019s innings.\u2019 Another passage of play, between the 29th and 34th overs, when experienced West Indies batsmen Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels were at the crease, will also be analysed in an effort to understand why just two runs were scored from five overs before 16 were hit off the 35th over. Putting the brakes on: Marlon Samuels (above) slowed things down batting with Gayle . ACSU investigators, who have been criticised in the past for failing to root out deep-seated corruption in cricket, will analyse betting patterns around those overs amid concerns that anyone with prior knowledge could have made a certain profit in the market for run predictions, which are usually based on totals in five-over \u2018brackets\u2019. The same process will occur for the second ODI. In May 2008, Samuels was suspended for two years. The West Indies Board said he had \u2018received money, benefit or other reward which could bring him or the game into disrepute\u2019. They looked into charges that Samuels had passed on team information to a bookmaker during a one-day series in India in January 2007, which he denied. Key to any investigation will be to establish a link between illegal bookmakers, normally working on behalf of billionaire businessmen in India or the Middle East, and the players. The ACSU have the power to access a player\u2019s bank records and analyse mobile phone data. Deleted text messages can be accessed through improved data retrieval methods. \u2018Players know we are on the look-out for wrongdoing, but they also know it\u2019s like looking for a needle in a haystack,\u2019 said an ICC source. The ICC and their constituent governing bodies have introduced education programmes in recent years to warn players of the dangers of getting involved with the murky underworld of black-market betting and reminding them of the potential punishments if they are caught. The ECB have looked to identify so-called \u2018court-siders\u2019 at county games who have the opportunity to interact with players, potentially garnering information about pitch conditions and teams. Strict limits on the processing of mobile data at county grounds have also been implemented in an effort to stop \u2018court-siders\u2019 passing real-time information on to bookies. Last week, two individuals were ejected from the T20 game between Northants and Somerset at Wantage Road after being caught by ECB anti-corruption officials phoning live commentary to the sub-continent. The nine-second time delay between live action and the TV broadcast in India is enough for \u2018market manipulation\u2019. The ECB say there have been 17 incidents this season, with 14 individuals removed from 13 different county grounds and they are putting pressure on broadcasters to reduce the gap between real-time action and when it is broadcast \u2018live\u2019. In the spotlight: County Championship games have seen 14 individuals removed this year . Banned: Pakistani trio (left to right) Mohammad Aamer, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were found guilty of spot-fixing in a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010 . Indian Premier League . The tournament has been shrouded in controversy since its inception and, in May this year, its reputation hit a new low when three players \u2014 Sree Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan \u2014 were arrested on suspicion of spot-fixing. So far 11 bookmakers and other associates have been arrested. One of those held in Mumbai was actor Virender \u2018Vindoo\u2019 Dara Singh. He led the police to Meiyappan Gurunath, a top official of Chennai Super Kings and son-in-law of Board of Cricket Control in India president N Srinivasan.Bangladesh Premier League . Another lucrative Twenty20 event engulfed by controversy. In May the ICC began investigating the tournament, and some English players and umpires who took part in the BPL have since been questioned, while Dhaka captain Mohammad Ashraful has admitted his part in fixing a game. The Bangladesh Cricket Board hired the ICC\u2019s anti-corruption team for an investigation in 2013 after Shariful Haque, a former international spinner, was found guilty of spot-fixing in the 2012 competition and was then banned indefinitely. County cricket . Mervyn Westfield\u2019s conviction for spot-fixing in Essex\u2019s CB40 game against Durham in 2010 brought the reality of corruption to the heart of English cricket. A 2011 game between Kent and Sussex remains the subject of a continuing investigation. With more county cricket now being televised in India, and a rise of \u2018mercenary\u2019 players moving from one global tournament to another with little or no team loyalty, the threat of corruption has arguably never been greater. In May, six illegal bookmakers were arrested by Indian police for their alleged role in fixing matches during the lucrative Indian Premier League. Since then, liquidity in the Betfair market, largely driven by money from cricket-obsessed India, has dropped \u2018dramatically\u2019, according to one industry insider. ACSU investigators face a tough job to establish a link between on-field behaviour and insider trading. Many markets are almost impossible to track, with trades carried out\u00a0 illegally in India and the Middle East. The ICC are expected to request more detailed information from legitimate bookmakers to try to identify potential wrong-doing surrounding West Indies v Pakistan, though with many online firms registered offshore for tax purposes, they are not obliged to provide information on their customers\u2019 activity. Spot of bother: Indian bowler Sreesanth is caught up in fixing claims . A \u2018memorandum of understanding\u2019 exists between sites such as Betfair but they do not come under the remit of the Gambling Act, which requires high street bookmakers in the UK to notify the publically owned Gambling Commission as well as the respective governing body of any suspicious behaviour. The ICC\u2019s anti-corruption unit were approached for an official statement but replied: \u2018It is our policy not to comment on any investigtion, ongoing or otherwise.\u2019 Betfair declined to comment, while a Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman said: \u2018We have no knowledge of an ICC investigation.\u2019 The West Indies Board were unavailable for comment.","output":"West indies-Pakistan series to be investigated .\nSuspect betting identified in tied ODI .\nSlow scoring rates will be at centre of inquiry ."}
{"input":"Jumping on a trampoline, Blaze Duckworth seems to be playing as happily as any two-year-old. But the little girl is bravely battling arthritis and requires daily injections to help her walk. Blaze was diagnosed with the crippling condition after being bedridden with a mystery illness for almost four months. Bouncing back: Two-year-old Blaze Duckworth, pictured playing on a trampoline, suffers from arthritis and needs daily injections to help her walk . Smiling: Blaze Duckworth (right) undergoes daily injections which are administered by her mother, Kelly O'Sullivan (left) Her mother, Kelly O'Sullivan, 23, who administers the injections herself, said: 'When we say to people that she has arthritis they always reply in shock and disbelief and they don\u2019t accept that she has it. 'It\u2019s still a shock to us too but, when you tell people and they don\u2019t believe us, that can be really hard. 'Everybody understands arthritis in the elderly but they don\u2019t expect it to be something a young person has.' Blaze, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, began feeling unwell at Christmas last year and developed symptoms including a rash, a temperature and sore knees. But when Ms O'Sullivan took the girl to her GP, she was told it was merely a viral infection. The girl was put on a course of antibiotics. Suffering: Blaze was bedridden for almost four months before her arthritis was diagnosed . Painful: Blaze began feeling unwell at Christmas last year and developed symptoms including a rash, a temperature and sore knees . Blaze's problems became worse during January as she became unable to walk and was in constant pain. After five visits to a GP, she was referred to Royal Bolton Hospital - where doctors were unable to find the cause of her symptoms. Ms O'Sullivan, who was pregnant with second child Lacey at the time, said: 'I took her to the doctor who said that she had a viral infection and put her on a course of antibiotics. 'But they didn\u2019t do anything - if anything it got worse. 'Then she started limping and by the end of January this year it got to the point where she would not even put weight on her feet and would stay in bed crying. 'Then the pain spread to her neck. She would hobble around holding her neck in pain - it was awful to watch. 'She had gone from being a bundle of fun who was always laughing and running about to not even being able to walk.' Blaze's arthritis was only diagnosed in April after she underwent an MRI scan at Manchester Children's Hospital. Treatment: Blaze was referred to a hospital after visiting her GP five times as her condition got worse . Ms O'Sullivan said: 'She went to the Royal Bolton Hospital for about four weeks but despite lots of blood tests and IV antibiotics nothing really helped that much because they were still treating her for an infection. 'She was discharged at the beginning of March when she got a little better, but in hindsight she had been given ibuprofen and I think that helped her with the inflammation. 'After three days she was back to square one and then referred her to Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital, where she stayed for six weeks. 'During all this time I was a mess. It was so frustrating...nobody knew what was wrong with her despite all the tests. 'It seemed like nobody knew what was going on with her and I was at my wits' end. She would just lie there and barely walked at all. 'She\u2019d even stopped eating in that time and she became anaemic. She had a lot of muscle wastage because she wasn\u2019t walking around and lost a lot of weight.' Ms O'Sullivan praised the doctors who finally discovered why Blaze was in so much pain. Mystery: Blaze, pictured in hospital with an intravenous drip, was not diagnosed with arthritis until April . Diagnosis: Blaze, pictured in hospital after undergoing lymph node tests, had an MRI scan at Manchester Children's Hospital and the nature of her condition became clear . 'I couldn\u2019t believe it when the consultant diagnosed her with arthritis,' she said. 'That\u2019s something that you associate with an old person - not a two-year-old child. 'They explained it to us by saying that it\u2019s an autoimmune disease meaning that her immune system almost works too well and wraps proteins around her joints and that causes the pain. 'She was moved on to daily injections to kill the protein and then a weekly injection that lowers her immune system to stop it over-working. 'I had to go into hospital to learn how to inject her, which was really hard because it\u2019s horrible to inject your own child and see them cry from it. 'She\u2019s getting better now because she\u2019s becoming used to it but once she sees me put the gloves on she goes quiet until it\u2019s done. Problems: Doctors at the Royal Bolton Hospital were unable to find the cause of Blaze's symptoms . Family photograph: Blaze sits with her younger sister Lacey. Their mother, Kelly O'Sullivan, was pregnant with Lacey when Blaze was taken ill . 'As long as she stays on the injections and the oral steroids she will be okay. If she didn\u2019t take them within a few days she wouldn\u2019t be able to walk again, so for the time being this is what she has to go through. 'The doctors have said that they want to keep her on this for a year and see what happens but there\u2019s no way of knowing whether she will grow out of it or if she will need to be on her medication forever. 'We\u2019re trying not to think that far ahead because we\u2019re just happy that she\u2019s smiling and running around like a normal two-year-old.' Ms O'Sullivan is backing a new awareness campaign ran by Arthritis Research UK which will demonstrate that the illness can develop at any age. She said: 'I just hope that if there are other parents out there that have a child with similar symptoms reading this, then they can be diagnosed quicker than Blaze was so they don\u2019t go through the upset we did.' Recovery: Blaze was given a range of medicines and needs daily injections to help her walk .","output":"Blaze Duckworth, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, needs injections to walk .\nShe became ill last Christmas but was not diagnosed until April this year ."}
{"input":"(CNN) -- A hair stylist is accusing former \"American Idol\" judge and rapper Nicki Minaj of wigging out on a deal. Terrence Davidson filed suit Friday in district court in Atlanta alleging that the star not only stole his wig designs, but also cost him a potential reality show deal that he was discouraged from pursuing. According to the complaint, Davidson started working for Minaj -- whose real name is Onika Maraj -- as her hair stylist in January 2010. He says he began making wigs for her which she would then select for her appearances. At the time Minaj was a burgeoning star who had steadily built her fan base by appearing as a guest rapper on mix tapes and projects by her label mates at Young Money Entertainment. She quickly became known as the first lady of Young Money, which includes superstar rappers Drake and Lil Wayne. The female rapper also became well known for her sense of style, including a multitude of wigs ranging from platinum blonde to pink. She poses in an ensemble which includes a pink wig on the cover of her platinum-selling debut album \"Pink Friday,\" released in November 2010. Both Davidson and his attorney, Christopher Chestnut, talked to CNN about his influence on crafting Minaj's image as well as the fact that the rapper now sells wigs on her site based on the designs Davidson says he created. The stylist said he discovered the wigs were being marketed and sold after someone sent him a picture and he began researching. \"I see these wigs online,\" said Davidson, who has also worked with others in the industry, including singer Patti LaBelle and rapper Remy Ma. \"People are basically duplicating what I created for Nicki Minaj.\" \"Nicki Minaj is reaping great success and financial bounty reward for Terrence's creative expertise, and he is entitled to participate in that,\" Chestnut said. \"Someone's got to stand up for the artist. We applaud the fact that she's making millions, but she's also got to pay bounty to those whose creative designs she's making millions off of.\" In his suit, Davidson says he designed several wigs for Minaj, including the \"Pink Upper Bun Wig,\" the \"Fox Fur Wig,\" and the \"Half Blonde-Half Pink Wig\" that she wore in appearances, including the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards preshow. He says there were plans for he and Minaj to launch a wig line and discussions about a possible reality show.

Taking bad news on the chin is not always easy \u2013 so perhaps Simon Cowell is simply trying to spread the load. The 53-year-old revealed an unsightly series of chins as he took a spin in his Ferrari over the weekend. It was a far cry from earlier in the . year, when he looked considerably firmer around the face \u2013 but the music . mogul was showing the signs of a saggy jawline in an appearance on . American TV last month. Larger than life: A fuller-faced Simon Cowell was photographed while taking a friend for a spin past his three Beverly Hills homes in his Ferrari 458 Italia Spyder . Cowell has endured a tough few months . as ratings for his UK X Factor show have slumped to their lowest ever . levels. On Saturday, the ITV1 programme drew an average of just eight . million viewers. In 2010, it typically attracted 13.6million. For the fourth week in a row, it was beaten by BBC1 rival Strictly Come Dancing, which was watched by 10.3million. Sinitta, Cowell\u2019s close friend and ex-girlfriend, said the current run has been the 'worst series ever'. She told The People: \u2018Simon says X . Factor is his first baby. He worries about the show and there is a lot . for him to worry about at the moment. Spot the difference: Cowell looked slimmer in March, left, but by October was seen on TV looking puffed up . \u2018He has so much affection for the UK show, he is the boss and he wants to be back on UK TV. Disappointed: Simon was annoyed to see Ella Henderson axed from the competition . \u2018The wrong people are going. He finds it frustrating.

'It is no secret he has missed . working on the UK show and he has not ruled out returning to the show as . a possibility in the future.' Cowell has always denied having cosmetic surgery, but has been remarkably candid about his Botox use. He once compared the wrinkle-smoothing injections to brushing his teeth, confessing: \u2018Of course I have had it. I mean, for me, it\u2019s like cleaning my teeth, you know? Something makes your teeth whiter or something stops you having lines.\u2019 He added: 'I think you\u2019ve got to be very careful as a guy, in particular, that you can end up looking really, really weird.'","output":"BBC One show won the ratings battle on Saturday by more than 2 million .\nMusic mogul was pictured as he took a drive in his Ferrari at the weekend ."}
{"input":"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The number of step families has slumped by 14 per cent in a decade, as women delay having children, new figures show. The changing face of Britain\u2019s families was revealed by data showing there were 544,000 families with children living with a stepparent in 2011, down from 631,000 ten years earlier. Couples who move in together with children from previous relationships are also being priced out parts of the country, because need larger homes with more bedrooms. The proportion of stepfamilies is lowest in London and the South East, where house prices are higher, suggesting larger families are being priced out of some areas . Between 2001 and 2011 the number of families where children lived with both parents rose by 4 per cent. But at the same time the number of stepfamilies fell by 14 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said. The dramatic change could be linked to several factors, including the decline in the number of children born to younger parents who are more likely to split up. The ONS said there were \u2018no clear reasons\u2019 for the fall in the number of stepfamilies but possible factors include a rise in the average age at which women have their first baby. \u2018This means that children are less likely to be born to younger couples who are more likely to break up. This may lessen the chance of children becoming stepchildren later on,\u2019 the ONS said. Single parents may also be increasingly likely to have a partner who lives elsewhere and essentially acts as a stepparent to their children without living with them permanently. Some 85 per cent of stepfamilies include children from the woman\u2019s previous relationship, 11m-er cent included children from the man\u2019s previous relationship and 4 per cent from both partners\u2019 previous relationships, according to the General Lifestyle Survey in 2011 for Great Britain. Almost one in 10 children lives in a stepfamily, the Office for National Statistics said . Suprrisngly, the proportion of stepfamilies varied across the country with numbers lowest in London and the South East where property prices are highest. The ONS said: \u2018The lowest proportions of couple families with dependent children which were stepfamilies in 2011 were in and to the west of London, extending along the M4 corridor. \u2018Meanwhile, the highest proportions were in coastal areas, south Wales, Norfolk and the East Midlands. \u2018Several reasons may contribute to this pattern including the presence of affordable housing because stepfamilies tend to be larger. \u2018For example, the cost of homes with enough bedrooms to accommodate children may prevent some people who both have children from moving in together in London and the South East.\u2019 Among stepfamilies where the parents have married, 28 per cent have three or more dependent\u00a0children compared with 17 per cent of married couple non-stepfamilies. Stepfamilies tend to be larger, in part because they can include children from both previous relationships . \u2018This may be expected as some couples may have one or more children from a previous relationship and go on to have another child within their current relationship,\u2019 the ONS said. \u2018Alternatively, children may come from both partners\u2019 previous relationships.\u2019 The number of stepfamilies in an area could also be linked to the number of lone parents. \u2018People from certain ethnic groups may have a lower likelihood of divorcing or having children outside marriage, and so of forming stepfamilies. These groups are not evenly spread around the country,\u2019 the ONS added. In England and Wales 1.1 million of children lived in a stepfamily in 2011, equivalent to 9 per cent. A total of 7.7 million, or 64 per cent, of children lived with both of their parents and 3.1 million or 26 per cent lived with a single parent. The majority of children living in stepfamilies lived with parents who have married - 689,000 compared to 418,000 where the parents in the stepfamily have not tied the knot.","output":"Number of stepfamilies falls from 631,000 in 2001 to 544,000 in 2011 .\nWomen having children later in life are less likely to split up .\nProportion of stepfamilies lowest in London and along M4 corridor ."}

The survey also found one in three women in the camp was not earning money before they were accused of being a witch and were seen as an economic burden by their community. However, the camps do provide sanctuary for women accused of being witches, as many in their communities believe the women cannot practice witchcraft once they are in a camp.

{"input":"(CNN) -- Across America, middle-class families are wondering how they'll send their kids to college, pay their mortgages and still manage to save enough for retirement. Women across America face an uphill climb in the workplace, as they continue to earn less than men. We still sit in traffic on congested roads built decades ago, and then drive on run-down roads and crumbling bridges. These are among the problems our elected leaders are expected to address. These are the issues voters want us to focus on. But those are not the issues that the American people will remember as the priorities of John Boehner and the 113th Congress. Instead, House Republicans have been focused on anything but strengthening the middle class. Under Boehner as speaker, they have hopscotched from issue to issue, not to govern, but in the hopes of finding the silver bullet to motivate their base to elect them -- because they know that they will lose on one crucial issue: the economy. Boehner and leading Republicans have said over and over that this election is about: the IRS, the Affordable Care Act, Benghazi, immigration -- and the list goes on. The headlines alone tell the story: . \u2022 11\/18\/13: Obamacare Mess Defines GOP 2014 Campaign Strategy (The Fiscal Times) \u2022 1\/31\/14: Republicans turn up IRS rhetoric as elections loom (Politico) \u2022 3\/21\/14: Republicans Double Down on Obamacare for 2014 (Time) \u2022 5\/08\/14: House GOP pursue Benghazi inquiry going into midterm campaigns (PBS) \u2022 5\/27\/14: House Vote on Former I.R.S Official Signals Element of GOP Election Strategy (New York Times) \u2022 8\/24\/14: Republicans Shift Focus To Immigration As Leading Election Issue (Huffington Post) \u2022 9\/23\/14: Republicans think the Islamic State is their winning issue (Washington Post) But there is one constant that the American will remember about the 113th Congress: John Boehner and the tea party shut down our government. That shutdown, a year ago this week, eventually cost our economy $24 billion and hurt millions of people across the country. And while Americans were sent home from work, were denied health care treatment, and, in the case of veterans, had their benefits delayed, Republican members of Congress kept getting paid on time and didn't even need to take a break from going to the taxpayer-funded congressional gym. Across the country, Americans have already started casting votes for the 114th Congress. Those voters now have the chance to decide whether they support candidates who put special interests ahead of working moms. They can decide whether they want leaders who think women should be able to make their own choices about their health care. Voters will be casting their ballots knowing which candidate will have their back and which one will have the back of special interests. And they will remember the standout moment from this Congress: that House Republicans, who could not work together with other lawmakers on solutions, went for a shutdown instead. In the 114th Congress, House Democrats will continue our focus on the Middle Class Jumpstart agenda, a plan built on the pillars of investing in infrastructure, making college more affordable and ensuring equal pay for equal work. Ask a Democrat what this election is about. He or she will tell you it's about strengthening the economy for America's middle class -- exactly what voters want.","output":"Steve Israel: Middle class worries about money, equal pay, crumbling infrastructure .\nHe says GOP has not shown these are its priorities; party instead attacks Obama .\nHe says Boehner's Congress will be remembered for shutting down government in 2013 .\nIsrael: Democrats running in 2014 will focus on the real priorities of the middle class ."}
{"input":"'In love': Prison governor Florent Goncalves, 42, faces a three-year sentence if found guilty of presenting an inmate with love letters and gifts . A former prison governor has appeared in a French court accused of giving special treatment to a notorious femme fatale criminal he had 'fallen in love' with. Florent Goncalves, 42, faces a three-year sentence for presenting the strikingly beautiful Emma Arbabzadeh, 23, with love letters and gifts. He regularly had sex with her in prison, but is solely being charged with illicit correspondence, and giving an inmate presents. Arbabzadeh became infamous in 2008 when she was found guilty of luring Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish salesman, to his death at the hands of a gang of racist killers called 'The Barbarians'. Arbabzadeh, who has since been released, has since featured in a book written by Goncalves, in which she is portrayed as a 'honey-trap' femme fatale who makes men 'lose their heads'. When Arbabzadeh began a nine-year sentence at Versailles women's prison near Paris, Goncalves is said to have selected her for 'special treatment'. But Goncalves's defence barrister, Pascal Garbarini, today told Versailles Correctional Court that his client had 'simply fallen in love and did not know how to control his passion'. He added: 'If there had been no Barbarians gang, then this would never have got to court. 'The truth is, this is simply a love story - an unlikely one, but still a love story.' Arbabzadeh is herself facing a charge of receiving stolen goods, but her barrister told the court that she had solely received two mobile phone chips. Dominique Attias said: 'There are thousands of mobile phones in prisons. But these cases don't all land up in court.' Mr Attias said the sensational Barbarians case had turned Arbabzadeh into a criminal celebrity. Inmate: In 2008, Arbabzadeh was found guilty of luring a Jewish salesman to his death at the hands of a gang of racist killers called 'The Barbarians' When other prisoners learned that she was having regular sex in the prison computer room, and in Goncalves's office, they complained. This led to a police investigation, after which Goncalves, who is married with children, was forced to resign. He was able to rekindle his relationship with Arbabzadeh when she was released in 2010. She had been let out for good behaviour after having been on remand since 2006. Goncalves then wrote a book in which he discussed the affair, saying 'I did not regret it for a moment', although he admitted that it had ruined his reputation as a happy family man and 'humanitarian' prison governor. Goncalves, who had been France's youngest ever prison governor, said Iranian-born Arbabzadeh had genuinely been in love with him. In a case which shocked France, Arbabzadeh was still a teenager when, in January 2006, she used her good looks to lure Mr Halimi to a flat on the outskirts of Paris. There he was tortured for three weeks before he died. A total of 27 people were convicted for playing a part in the murder, with anti-Semitism and profiting from a failed ransom plot cited as the motive. Goncalves denies the charges. The case continues.","output":"Florent Goncalves accused of having sex with inmate - and giving her love letters and gifts .\nInmate  Emma Arbabzadeh lured Jewish salesman to his death at hands of racist killers ."}
{"input":"Bronwyn and Jim Monro adopted\u00a0Nishantha from Sir Lanka into their family when he was 16 months old . When Bronwyn and Jim Monro were told  that their adopted son was schizophrenic 20 years ago, they had no idea what the illness was or what it would come to mean for their family. Their son\u2019s diagnosis, when he was 18-years-old, came after a \u2018screaming episode\u2019 in the park near their home in the sought-after suburb of Balmain, in Sydney\u2019s inner west. \u2018He was screaming and running around the park. We called the ambulance and police\u2026 there are steep cliffs in the park and we were scared he was going to jump off,\u2019 Mrs Monro told Daily Mail Australia. \u2018That\u2019s really scary when you don\u2019t understand that they are mentally ill, you don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 The couple, who are both retired teachers, adopted Nishantha into their family at the age of 16 months, in 1976. He was abandoned at birth and found on the doorsteps of a children\u2019s hospital in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka. They will never know if his mental illness is genetic because the hospital had no records of who his biological parents are. \u2018I used to wonder if the rejection from his parents caused his illness,\u2019 Mrs Monro recalled. She said Nishantha was \u2018tricky\u2019 from a young age. He would skip classes at school and teachers would describe him as \u2018very bright but quiet difficult to manage.\u2019 Mrs Monro, 66, and Mr Monro, 69, already had two biological daughters, now aged 43 and 40, when they adopted him. Three years later they also adopted Chaminda, who became Nisantha\u2019s brother. The couple first took Nishantha to a councillor when he was only little. \u2018We knew it was quite difficult to come from overseas and fit in and Balmain is a very yuppy area, there weren\u2019t very many black kids around back then,\u2019 Mrs Monro explained. The Monro family: Kara, Chaminda, Zoe, Nishantha, Jim and Bronwyn (from left to right) lived in the sought-after suburb of Balmain in Sydney's inner-west as the children grew up . Nishantha Monro, pictured here at the age of 18, was diagnosed with schizophrenia 20 years ago . Although Nishantha has never spoken about being bullied growing up in Sydney, his mother conceded that he may have had a hard time. At the age of 15 he took an overdose. \u2018I was highly alarmed but I had no idea it was about mental health, it just wasn\u2019t spoken about at the time,\u2019 Mrs Monro said. \u2018When he took his overdose we still didn\u2019t know he was going to develop schizophrenia. I didn\u2019t even know what it was when he got the diagnosis at 18,\u2019 she added. The Monros had no history of mental health illness in their family and even the doctors at the time of Nishantha\u2019s overdose did not suspect he was schizophrenic. The terrifying incident happened in 1994 and Mr and Mrs Monro were told their son simply had a personality disorder. A psychiatrist said \u2018he\u2019s very spontaneous, he doesn\u2019t think\u2019. Nishantha, seen here at four years old (left) and in the park at the age of eight (right), \u00a0was 'tricky' from a young age. Teachers would describe him as 'very bright but quiet difficult to manage,' his mother said . Nishantha was a member of his local scouts group. In this photo he is off to a jamboree at the age of 14 . At 17, Nishantha had started drinking. He was sneaking out at night and taking drugs and when he was 18, after the screaming incident in the park, he punched a hole in the wall and left home. \u2018We didn\u2019t understand so we were in this mode of disapproval. He didn\u2019t talk about his feeling but we never invited a discussion because we thought if we used strong parenting we could \u201csort it out\u201d,\u2019 Mrs Monro said. When Nishantha left home he began drinking a lot. \u2018After his landlord chucked him out of one flat, he moved to another place opposite a bottle shop,\u2019 she added. His mother agrees that his drug and alcohol use may be a way to block out his schizophrenia. And last November he stopped taking his prescribed medication, claiming it made him sleepy. \u2018He\u2019s still so impulsive and we wonder whether the medication affects his enjoyment of the drugs , the medications are supposed to dull you down a bit and we wonder if they do that inhibit his ability to feel pleasure in life,\u2019 Mrs Monro explained. Bronwyn and Jim Monro want to speak openly about their son and reduce the stigma around schizophrenia . By the age of 21 Nishantha, seen here with his adopted brother Chaminda, had left home and was battling with an alcohol addiction . Nishantha lives in a housing commission building in Redfern. His mother has concerns about him living there because there are \u2018drugs and alcohol everywhere\u2019. He\u2019s provided with a disability pension, while Mrs Monro - who worked as a teacher for 42 years - now acts as his carer. \u2018He wants to live with us but that would give him more money for drugs and alcohol. When you are not in this drug world it\u2019s very hard to understand. I do try to be positive.\u2019 Over the years Mrs Monro and her husband Jim have gone from knowing nothing about schizophrenia and mental health to educating themselves so that they can not only understand and help their son but also share their experience with other families. They run the Balmain schizophrenia carers group once a month and Mrs Monro also runs a carers group for older ladies in Belmore . \u2018We\u2019ve done a lot of courses so we\u2019ve got more educated and informed about drug matters. 'You have no idea what a nice person my son is': Mrs Monro described her son as 'quirky' but said she has never once been scared of him. He is seen here in 2009 at 32 (left) and at 27 in 2002 (right) Mrs Monro said the happiest times she shares with her son are when he opens up to her about his feelings . \u2018A burden shared is a burden halved. Just listening to others and being able to share my story means a lot to me\u2026 Jim and I believe we need to be open about mental health so people don\u2019t get caught like we were,\u2019 she said. Mrs Monro wants to reduce the stigma around schizophrenia and wants the world to know that the illness does not make someone dangerous. She said she has never been concerned for her own safety around her son. \u2018You have no idea what a nice person my son is; he has a quirky personality and is so engaging when he\u2019s functioning well.\u2019 Nishantha is now using meth amphetamine, commonly known as ice, which Mrs Monro said makes him \u2018cranky and irritable\u2019 and means he does \u2018a lot of screaming\u2019. \u2018He tells us he\u2019s been screaming on the bus and in his flat. But my son is not violent.\u2019 For Mrs Monro, the happiest times she shares with her son are when he opens up to her about his feelings. \u2018He doesn\u2019t very often say it but sometime he says \u201cI know you love and care for me\u201d and he says \u201cI don\u2019t have any friends now, you and dad are the only people\u201d. Jim Monro, a retired TAFE teacher, seen here with Nishantha on October 21 2013 . Bronwyn (pictured) said she has spent years learning about schizophrenia so she can empathise with her son . \u2018The other good moments are when you feel like you can understand him and can stand in his shoes for a few minutes. The only way I could get an insight into his perspective is to do all this training. Jack Heath, CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia said carers are under pressure . \u2018When you grow up in a moralistic upright church way like we did sometimes it\u2019s hard to understand.\u2019 Bronwyn and Jim want to open the discussion around mental health and not turn people off the subject and are supporting charity SANE with a new drive for carers. Over the last decade in Australia, the delivery of mental health services has shifted from institutions to the community, which often means that families carry more and more of the burden of supportive care. More than 230,000 Australians have schizophrenia and it can have a profound effect on those close to them as family members may have feelings of guilt and shame and may have to cope with loved ones who have difficult and demanding behaviour. A new health coaching service for carers of those living with schizophrenia will also soon be launching called CareCompass and a new resource has been launched to help share information called Full Story Schizophrenia. Jack Heath, CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia told Daily Mail Australia: \u2018When a family is first struck by an incident of severe mental illness, they don\u2019t know what to do and where to turn to. But if they feel part of community it helps.' Mr Heath explained how carers also need a break. 'I've spoken to so many carers over the years and it's challenging for them... they tend to through everything  and not remember to look after themselves and they get quite high rates of depression themselves,' he said.

{"input":"It might make up more than 80 per cent of the known universe, but as of yet scientists have still not managed to directly observe one of the universe\u2019s greatest mysteries - dark matter. In recent months there have been detections from the sun and in orbit around Earth, but now scientists think they have found it in neighbouring galaxies. They spotted photon emissions coming from space - and one of the best possible explanations is that they came from particles of dark matter. Scroll down for video explanation . Research led by Leiden University in the Netherlands has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter (illustrated). They analysed X-ray signals emitted by the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. The signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter . Two groups have recently announced that they have detected a signal that could be a sign of dark matter, with the research to be published next week in Physical Review Letters. One of them, which included Netherlands-based Leiden University scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky, found it by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up: the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces.There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light, but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe. After having collected thousands of signals from the Esa's XMM-Newton telescope and eliminated all those coming from known particles and atoms, they detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention. The signal appears in the X-ray spectrum as a weak, abnormal photon emission that could not be attributed to any known form of matter. Above all, \u2018the signal's distribution within the galaxy corresponds exactly to what we were expecting with dark matter, that is, concentrated and intense in the centre of objects and weaker and diffuse on the edges,\u2019 explained Dr Ruchayskiy. \u2018With the goal of verifying our findings, we then looked at data from our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and made the same observations,\u2019 added Dr Boyarsky. The discovery was made using Esa's XMM-Newton telescope (illustration shown). The researchers detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention - as it could be the best sign of dark matter yet . The signal comes from a very rare event in the universe: a photon emitted due to the destruction of a hypothetical particle, possibly a \u2018sterile neutrino\u2019. If the discovery is confirmed, it will open up new avenues of research in particle physics. \u2018It could usher in a new era in astronomy,\u2019 said Dr Ruchayskiy. And Dr Boyarsky said: \u2018Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles. \u2018We will know where to look in order to trace dark structures in space and will be able to reconstruct how the universe has formed.\u2019 The research, to be published in Physical Review Letters, included EPFL scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky. They found the signal by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy (shown)","output":"Research led by Leiden University in the Netherlands has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter .\nThey analysed X-ray signals emitted by the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy .\nThe signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter .\nInstead it must be a particle of dark matter, according to the researchers .\n\u2018It could usher in a new era in astronomy,\u2019 said Dr Ruchayskiy ."}
{"input":"Barack Obama last night threw David Cameron a political lifeline by following his lead in giving US politicians the chance to veto air strikes on Syria. In an unprecedented move, the President said he was determined to bomb Syria \u2013 but not until Congress voted on the matter. In theory, as Commander-in-Chief of US forces, he could ignore any Congress vote against military action, but having invited them to do so it is considered highly unlikely. President Obama has declared the US should take military action against Bashar Al-Assad's regime . Speaking at the White House rose garden, President Obama said he would seek congressional backing for any intervention . The Syrian army restarted its barrage . on the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus just two minutes after President . Obama finished his speech threatening air strikes. The attacks had . stopped five hours earlier. Regime forces also immediately \u2018intensified\u2019 attacks on Aleppo in Northern Syria. But on the streets of Damascus, those opposing Assad reacted with fury and disbelief that US intervention was not imminent. \u2018What did we go through all that for?\u2019 asked one woman. \u2018Assad is victorious.\u2019 Speaking . from the White House Rose Garden, Mr Obama referred directly to Mr . Cameron\u2019s decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue and again referred . to Britain as America\u2019s \u2018closest ally\u2019. Mr . Cameron\u2019s gamble backfired when Labour leader Ed Miliband, backed by . Tory and Lib Dem rebels, inflicted a shock defeat, keeping Britain out . of the conflict. Tory MPs . feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to Mr Cameron\u2019s . standing at home and abroad \u2013 and to the Anglo-US \u2018special . relationship.\u2019 But Mr . Obama\u2019s extraordinary decision to emulate Mr Cameron, immediately hailed . by the Prime Minister\u2019s supporters as \u2018a huge compliment\u2019, could turn . the tables on Mr Miliband, who believed he had scored a notable success. As UN inspectors crossed the border from Syria into Lebanon, they were followed out of the war-torn country by a continuous flow of families . Within . minutes of Mr Obama\u2019s statement, a relieved Mr Cameron tweeted: \u2018I . understand and support Barack Obama\u2019s position on #Syria.\u2019 And Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted: \u2018A fine speech by the President of the United States on #Syria.\u2019 The extraordinary development from Washington came at the end of Mr Cameron\u2019s worst week in No 10 since winning power in 2010. The . Prime Minister was widely criticised for misjudging his plan to support . US plans to punish the Syrian regime after the massacre of hundreds of . civilians near Damascus. According to US intelligence reports, 1,429 . people were killed by chemical weapons on August 21, including hundreds . of children. The Prime Minister quickly took to Twitter to endorse the president's approach . Mr Obama\u2019s . warm praise for Britain came only 24 hours after the White House had . called France, which has backed the military action, as its \u2018oldest . ally\u2019. In one sentence, Mr Obama appears to have restored the old order. Mr . Obama\u2019s comments about the need for a democratic vote on strikes . against Syria echoed almost word-for-word Mr Cameron\u2019s\u00a0 justification . for asking MPs to support him. Flanked . by Vice-President Joe Biden, the President said that he remained . convinced military action against Assad was needed and that there was no . need to wait for the\u00a0 UN weapons inspectors to report on the massacre. Then . he explained why he was taking the same democratic course as Mr . Cameron: \u2018Many people have advised against taking this decision to . Congress and undoubtedly they were impacted by what we saw happen in the . United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed . to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister . supported taking action. 'Yet, . while I believe I have the authority to carry out this action without . specific congressional authorisation I know that the country will be . stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more . effective.\u2019 A source close to Mr Cameron said: \u2018We are delighted the president has done this. It vindicates the Prime Minister completely.\u2019 President Obama revealed advisers had cautioned against going to Congress, particularly in light of the Commons defeat David Cameron suffered . Mr . Obama said:\u00a0 \u2018We saw terrible images of the dead. All told 1,000 people . were murdered including several hundred children. Young boys and girls . were gassed to death by their own government. This was an assault on . human dignity and a serious danger to security.\u2019 Mr . Obama assured the US public: \u2018We will not put boots on the ground\u2019 but . said the US was \u2018prepared to strike whenever we choose\u2019. He . added, \u2018I know well that we are weary of war. That is why we\u2019re not . contemplating putting our troops in the middle [of a civil war]. But we . cannot and must not turn a blind eye to actions in Damascus.\u2019 Where could they strike? This map of Syria highlights the main strategic towns in the strife-torn country . Target Damascus: Locations within the Syrian capital that would likely bear the brunt of any attack . However . Vladimir Putin yesterday dismissed claims that Syria used chemical . weapons as \u2018nonsense\u2019 and challenged the United States to provide proof . before launching air strikes. The . Russian President insisted that if Washington had evidence Bashar . Assad\u2019s forces \u2018used weapons of mass destruction\u2019 it should be presented . to the United Nations. But . Mr Putin said: \u2018If they say that the [Syrian] governmental forces used . weapons of mass destruction\u2026 and that they have proof of it, let them . present it to the UN inspectors and the UN security council. \u2018Claims that the proof exists, but is classified and cannot be presented to anybody, are below criticism.\u2019 There was no immediate response to Mr Putin\u2019s intervention from the White House. A UN convoy of vehicles, carrying the UN team of inspectors, crosses into Lebanon from Syria, at the Lebanese border crossing point of Masnaa, eastern Bekaa valley, Lebanon . UN weapons inspectors arrive at the headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, in The Hague, in the Netherlands . President Obama said he was 'comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council' that had so far been 'unwilling to hold Assad accountable' The . President faces an uphill battle to get Congressional permission to . attack Syria. As it stands, the Republican-controlled lower House of . Representatives will almost certainly deny permission while the . Democratically-controlled Senate might give him a reluctant go ahead. Some . Washington-based analysts said last night that Mr Obama could suffer . the same humiliation as Mr Cameron \u2013 and lose the vote. His decision to delay military was criticised by Syria\u2019s main opposition party, the Syrian National Coalition. A . spokesman said: \u2018I am surprised that the President said he has the . legal authority and the moral responsibility to respond but then to pass . this on to Congress. \u2018The people of Syria will feel that this is inaction. \u2018This is a failure of leadership on the President\u2019s part. \u2018I . thought this announcement was to tell the whole world that he is going . to punish this brutal regime and let them know they cannot use chemical . weapons against their own people.\u2019 But . last night Syria\u2019s prime minister Wael al-Halqi said his country was . prepared for US military action.

A great grandmother who suffered from Parkinson's disease was repeatedly left semi-naked in soiled bedding by hospital carers in the weeks leading up to her death. Doris Paver 79, died at St James's Hospital in Leeds, where it is claimed staff failed to monitor her care and even subjected her to an unnecessary surgical procedure. Mrs Paver was admitted to the West Yorkshire hospital after collapsing at her nursing home in Leeds, and later developed several pressure ulcers and a severe bed sore. It is claimed she was stripped of her dignity after being left in a state of undress in soiled bedding on several occasions while in the hospital's care. There were also concerns that her feeding tube was fitted inappropriately into her stomach and that staff failed to control her pain. Her daughter Valerie King also alleged that the hospital took longer than needed to provide a specialist mattress. She also added that staff failed to keep records on how often she was turned over to prevent further ulcers. Mrs King, 56, was awarded a four-figure pay-out from Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust after consulting solicitors. Now she has hit out at the Trust, who she says failed to provide basic care, which in turn contributed to her mother's death in May 2011. She said: 'It was stressful enough dealing with the emotional strain of a sick mother, without the added worry about her physical well-being, a lack of adequate pain management and a loss of dignity for the duration of her stay. 'It was clear to me from the outset that mum was not getting the proactive support she desperately needed from the nursing and medical teams.'

While James Thompson, medical negligence solicitor at Simpson Millar's in Leeds, who handled the case added: 'Mrs Paver suffered throughout with poorly controlled pain, a dry mouth and was left in soiled bedding with little respect to her dignity. 'This is a very sad case and the family hope that as a result of bringing these issues to the fore, the Trust will offer training and reassurance that there will not be a recurrence of such inadequate hospital care.'","output":"Staff at St James's Hospital failed to monitor the care given to Doris Paver .\nClaimed she was stripped of dignity and left semi-naked in soiled bedding .\nConcerns also raised about her feeding tube and failure to control her pain .\nThe 79-year-old also developed pressure ulcers and bed sores .\nFamily have been awarded a four-figure pay out after consulting solicitors .\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals Trust say they hope to learn from their failures ."}

{"input":"Michael Brown allegedly told his friend to keep running after Darren Wilson shot him for the first time. Court documents released by a prosecutor revealed the testimony by Dorian Johnson, who claimed the 18-year-old said 'Keep runnin', bro' as they fled the scene. In a police interview, heard by the Grand Jury, Johnson said that he saw blood spattered on Brown's shirt, prompting they pair to sprint away from the cop. They then knelt down between two cars to hide before Brown told his friend he should keep going. He also claims that Brown told Wilson that he was unarmed before he fired off several more shots. The St. Louis County prosecutor has released more documents related to the investigation of the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer, including a transcript of a police interview with Dorian Johnson (pictured center, at Brown's funeral), the friend who was with Brown when he was killed . The testimony reads: 'Now when I, when Mike passes me, he looked directly into my eyes and he saw where I was\u2014where I was crouched down. He says, verbatim, 'Keep runnin', bro. He also said: 'I'm watchin' as he turns around. The officer's face-to-face with him now and he goes to tell the officer that he's unarmed or he does not have a gun. 'I couldn't hear him verbatim from where I was standing, but I know he tried to talk to the officer and he tried to get out a second sentence, but before he could fully get out the sentence, the officer then fired several more shots.' Last week a prosecutor released hundreds of pages of additional documents Saturday from the investigation into the police shooting of Michael Brown, including an interview transcript of a friend who initially asserted that he had seen Brown get shot in the back. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said the newly released records were inadvertently excluded from the thousands of pages of other documents made public Nov. 24, when a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown. The freshly publicized documents include a transcript of an interview of Brown's friend Dorian Johnson conducted by the FBI and county police just four days after the Aug. 9 confrontation in which the white officer shot the black 18-year-old. Previously released forensic evidence showed that Brown was not shot in the back but was struck by bullets in the head, chest and arm. Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 28 (left), shot unarmed teen Michael Brown, 18, (right) dead on August 9 . Johnson's account to investigators was generally similar to his later grand jury testimony, in which he portrayed Wilson as the aggressor during a struggle that began at the officer's vehicle and led to a brief chase before Brown's fatal shooting. In both his original interview and his Sept. 10 grand jury testimony, which was previously released, Johnson said that Wilson reached out of his vehicle window toward Brown's throat or shirt. During the ensuring struggle, Johnson said he never saw Brown touch Wilson's gun. Wilson told grand jurors that Brown grabbed ahold of his weapon and twisted it toward the officer's leg. The officer eventually fired his gun from inside the vehicle. Forensic evidence showed that Brown's hand was shot at close range. Brown and Johnson then ran. In his August interview, Johnson initially was adamant that he had seen Johnson get shot in the back while running. 'It definitely struck him in his back,' Johnson said, later adding: 'It caused him to stop.' Asked by a detective how he knew Brown had been shot in the back, Johnson replied: 'If it would've missed him, or if he wouldn't have felt it, I believe he would've kept runnin.' Under further questioning, Johnson later acknowledged that he didn't see a bullet hit Brown's back, but he remained adamant that Brown's back was toward Wilson when he fired a shot. By almost all witness accounts, Brown turned at some point to face the officer. Johnson described Brown's hands as being raised, one higher than the other. Wilson told grand jurors that one of Brown's hands was clenched in a fist and the other at his waist as Brown began charging back at Wilson. As with the previously released grand jury documents, the witness transcripts released Saturday varied in their accounts of Brown's hands. One witness said Brown's 'hands kinda went up.' Another said Brown's hands were up briefly but he then ran toward Wilson.

{"input":"(CNN) -- Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains. Animal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its \"Operation Lion Ark.\" The flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses. The 25 felines are currently housed in a 15,000-square-foot temporary biosphere, complete with grass, trees and other natural features, at the sanctuary in Keenesburg, about 30 miles northeast of Denver. They're sleeping better, are getting exercise and have begun to roar in unison, \"which demonstrates they are beginning to bond as we expected,\" said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary. The ADI campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from TV game show host Bob Barker. Barker and actress Jorja Fox of \"CSI\" described the campaign Wednesday night on HLN's \"Jane Velez-Mitchell. \"It is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish quickly,\" Fox said of the law and the rescue of the lions, which were part of eight circuses. Of the 25 lions, 24 were seized from circuses, many the traveling variety. Eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck, Fox said, and at least two had never seen other lions. The sanctuary is building a permanent 80-acre fenced site for the lions, which will live in four prides, Craig told CNN. They'll get along just fine with the climate in Colorado, he said, because they are exposed to the cold in North Africa. Living in Bolivia put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late March or April. \"It was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter,\" said Fox. The 320-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses more than 275 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats. The Wild Animal Sanctuary emphasizes its mission is to serve as a sanctuary, not for entertainment. \"It's a home for animals, not a zoo for people,\" Craig said. Animal rights activists and groups are optimistic that Bolivia's 2009 action will lead other countries to ban animals in circuses and change conditions in zoos. \"I'm against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals,\" Barker told HLN. The sanctuary uses proceeds from its annual 50,000 visitors to cover the costs of their visit, Craig said. \"We hope they become long-term contributors.\" About 80 percent of the carnivores at the facility, which costs about $2.5 million a year to operate, were in the United States when they were seized from deplorable or illegal situations, he added. Most of the lions will have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population. Lionesses receive estrogen implants so that they won't go into heat. That reduces the competition and fighting among males. Craig praised Bolivia for taking action. \"This is the first country that stepped up,\" he said. He expects Peru, Ecuador and other countries to take steps that eliminate or limit the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues. Cities and states in the United States are taking a hard look at the treatment of elephants and carnivores, according to Craig. The 25 lions are adjusting well, appear calm and enjoy stretching their legs while running and playing. \"Like many rescued animals that come from extreme captive situations, they are quickly accepting all of the positive changes that are happening,\" Craig told CNN. \"There is nowhere to go but up when you have lived at the bottom, so they are open to grasping every opportunity to enjoy life that we present. This will continue all the way until they are roaming freely in large acreage habitats, when they can complete their journey.\" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report .","output":"Twenty-five lions have new home at Colorado sanctuary .\nThey were brought from Bolivia, where they were in traveling circuses .\nSouth American country banned use of animals in circuses .\nBob Barker helped fund the effort to move them ."}

Arrest: Danny Care, 25, has been held on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman in Leeds . England rugby player Danny Care has been questioned about an alleged sexual assault on a woman in a nightclub. The 25-year-old Harlequins and England scrum half was arrested by West Yorkshire Police officers following an incident in Leeds. Care has already accepted a police caution for being drunk and disorderly on the same night after he was arrested for urinating outside the city's landmark Queens Hotel. He was questioned again earlier this month in connection with a sexual assault on the woman. The player had now been bailed pending further inquiries over the alleged incident in the early hours of Sunday March 4. His club said today he denies the allegation. A spokesman for Harlequins said: 'Danny Care was asked to report to West Yorkshire Police in Leeds to answer further questions about the incident that took place in the city on March 3. 'On March 15 Danny attended Leeds Police Station voluntarily by appointment to assist the police with their inquiries. He denies the allegations made against him.

The player was held outside a Weybridge bar in December. In January, Care was fined a total of \u00a33,100 and banned from driving for 16 months after pleading guilty to drink-driving in the early hours of New Year's Day. He was stopped at the Winchester services on the M3 motorway in Hampshire in the early hours, Southampton Magistrates' Court heard. He was barred from playing for England following this conviction.

{"input":"(CNN) -- The National Basketball Association's strategy for forcing the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers by Donald Sterling hinges on a document the owner signed when he bought the team in 1981 that lays out reasons ownership could be terminated, a source familiar with the situation said Wednesday. Sterling has been banned for life from the team's day-to-day operations and facilities and was fined $2.5 million last week for racist comments that were recorded and posted online late last month. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 NBA owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. The matter is with the Advisory\/Finance Committee, which met Wednesday on a conference call. Members discussed the \"termination of Mr. Sterling's ownership of the team,\" the NBA said in a news release. The committee will meet again next week, the statement said. If the case proceeds to a full vote, 75% of the owners would have to approve the forced sale. The source told CNN that on several occasions since 1981 Sterling has signed other agreements with the NBA -- some within the past decade -- that contained moral clauses. Sterling's comments, the source explained, puts the 80-year-old owner in violation of Article 13(d) of the NBA constitution, which states that an owner can lose the team if he fails or refuses to \"fulfill its contractual obligations to the Association, its Members, Players, or any other third party in such a way as to affect the Association or its Members adversly.\" It is unclear what percentage of the team Sterling owns. A family trust owns the Clippers, and his wife, Shelly Sterling, has indicated that she is a co-owner and wants to keep the team. Donald Sterling, a lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, has not spoken publicly since the celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording in which he chastises a woman for posting pictures on Instagram in which she poses with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. On Tuesday, one of Sterling's longtime friends, former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, said the remarks were not surprising. But he had no admiration for the woman who recorded them, V. Stiviano. \"I've been a friend of that guy's for 30 years,\" Lasorda said while getting an honorary degree from Northwood University in West Palm Beach, Florida. \"It doesn't surprise me that he said those things. And he shouldn't have said it. He just hurt himself by talking too much and doing things he shouldn't be doing.\" As for Stiviano? \"And I don't wish that girl any bad luck,\" he said, \"but I hope she gets hit with a car.\" Stiviano, through attorney Mac E. Nehoray, has denied leaking the recordings, another of which was posted by the sports website Deadspin.

Carson did measure his kudos to the President, adding in the opinion piece that the U.S. response \"should go far beyond proportionality.\" Obama had said that the U.S. would respond proportionally to the cyberattack, which the FBI said North Korea was \"responsible\" for. North Korea denied involvement in the Sony hack and instead threatened attacks on \"all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists.\" \"The response should go far beyond proportionality, and an example should be made of the perpetrators by using a host of available options to inflict the kind of punishment that will not be easily forgotten,\" Carson wrote, adding that he believes the U.S. \"appears to be a paper tiger\" and is less respected and feared around the world.

{"input":"U.S. drone strikes killed at least nine suspected members of al Qaeda in Yemen, where clashes intensified Tuesday between the terrorist group and Shia Houthi rebels, local security officials said. The three airstrikes in Yemen's Al Baitha province, near Radaa district, targeted al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula vehicles on their way to fight Houthis, the three security officials said. The air component came amid fighting on the ground in the province that, according to the officials, killed at least 36 fighters from both sides. Over the years, the Yemeni military, aided by American drone strikes, has failed to beat back AQAP. Yet the Houthis, a militant group that follows the Zaidi sect of Islam, have managed to defeat al Qaeda on numerous fronts, last week sweeping its militants from a stronghold in Al Baitha province. This push spurred AQAP to threaten to kill Houthi followers wherever they are spotted. More than 400 people have been killed from both sides over the past month in ongoing clashes in Al Baitha and Ibb provinces. While Houthis have been critical of U.S. drone strikes in the past, they have not objected to their use in the last month. The Houthis swept to power in Yemen after signing a ceasefire deal with the government in September, ending a political crisis that had halted life in Sanaa and left more than 300 dead in a month. Surge in fighting threatens Yemen's survival . Soldiers killed . Since 2012, Houthis have exploited Yemen's political vacuum to assert their own regional pull over the country's highlands while expanding their political traction by establishing Ansar Allah, their new political group. On Saturday, the Interior Ministry confirmed that al Qaeda attacked a government military facility and killed 19 soldiers in the port province of Hodeida. One day later, Houthis sent dozens of fighters there and forced al Qaeda to retreat. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for eight attacks against Houthis across Yemen in the past three weeks through its official Twitter account. Al Qaeda resurgent in Yemen amid political turmoil . Guerrilla tactics . After taking control of Sanaa, hundreds of Houthi fighters created checkpoints inside and surrounding the Yemeni capital. They have also expanded their reach into most northern Yemeni provinces. But Houthis are finding it more difficult to crush al Qaeda in Al Baitha, considered one of the network's main strongholds in central Yemen. \"Houthis are used to military clashes, while al Qaeda uses guerrilla tactics against its enemies. They hit and run unexpectedly,\" said AbdulSalam Mohammed, president of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center. \"Rules of war are different when fighting al Qaeda,\" he said. The Houthis have long complained that they have been marginalized and persecuted by Yemen's Sunni majority, and have been involved in a series of rebellions since 2004, justifying their actions by claiming self-defense. They are organized under the leadership of Abdel Malek al Houthi. Adding to an increasingly volatile situation, a secessionist movement in the south of Yemen, al Hirak, has stepped up protests in Aden, Yemen's chief port and the largest city in the south.","output":"Yemeni officials: U.S. drone strikes kill at least nine suspected al Qaeda militants .\nHouthi militias are battling al Qaeda-linked group for territory in Yemen .\nMore than 400 people have died in clashes between the two groups in the past month .\nThe Houthis are trying to expand their reach after taking control of the capital, Sanaa ."}

{"input":"The rates of U.S. children affected by attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are skyrocketing, according to a recent report, but experts caution that the latest numbers require a bit of decoding. That information shows that 11% of children aged 4 to 17 were diagnosed with ADHD, a 16% increase since 2007, the last time that researchers at Centers for Disease Control (CDC) did a comprehensive survey for the prevalence of the neurobehavior disorder. The rise was especially dramatic among boys, with an estimated 1 in 5 boys in high school diagnosed with ADHD. What's more, about two-thirds of the children diagnosed were treated with stimulant medications that can improve attention but also come with side effects. Are rates truly climbing at such an alarming rate? Possibly. But many experts believe that's unlikely. The data was collected by the CDC and analyzed and reported by the New York Times; the CDC plans to publish its own report on the data in the coming months. TIME.com: Are ADHD medications being overused? To start, the information on ADHD rates came from parents reporting on the diagnosis for their children during telephone interviews. Such reports are useful but not as reliable as the verified diagnoses from medical or school records, says Dr. William Barbaresi, director of the developmental medicine center at Boston Children's Hospital. Second, such records-based data suggests that ADHD rates among children may be somewhere between 7.5% and 9.5%, with boys at the higher end of the range, not 11%. In its previous round of analysis, CDC found that ADHD diagnoses rose by 22% between 2003 and 2007, based on the same telephone surveys of 76,000 families in the United States, climbing by an average of 3% to 6% each year between 2000 and 2010. But the latest figures, which included responses collected between 2011 and 2012, show a far higher prevalence that hints at classrooms full of hyperactive and impulsive kids. \"By definition, ADHD requires that symptoms have to have a significant effect on life,\" says Barbaresi. \"To say that a tenth of all children have a biologic condition that affects their life enough to call it a disorder just does not make sense.\" TIME.com: Teens taking ADHD drugs to get good grades . If that's the case, then a significant proportion of these children may also be mistreated with medications that they don't need. \"This report and others raises questions about whether we may not be overdiagnosing ADHD and overusing medications,\" says Dr. Thomas Power, director of the center for management of ADHD at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. That could have serious implications for children's long term mental and physical health, since ADHD drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall have been linked to dramatic weight loss and suppressed growth. And some experts have voiced concern that early use of the behavior-modifying drugs could alter the natural arc of children's social and creative development. TIME.com: New ADHD guidelines include kids as young as 4 . The apparent rise in the prevalence of ADHD highlights several shortcomings in the way that not only ADHD, but mental health issues in general, are diagnosed and treated in the United States, says Barbaresi. Most children are labeled with the disorder by their pediatrician or family doctor, who aren't always trained in providing the in-depth evaluation that a reliable diagnosis requires. \"Symptoms are not and should not be sufficient,\" says Ruth Hughes, CEO of Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). \"The symptoms have to occur every day for a long period of time, and, more importantly, these symptoms have to lead to major disruption or impairment in at least two areas of a person's life, such as at school or in relationships.\" While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently provided an updated guideline on the criteria for a proper ADHD diagnosis, including reports not only from parents but from teachers and other daycare personnel about a child's hyperactive, impulsive and inattentive behavior, not all physicians have the time to carefully collect and vet the input from these sources. TIME.com: Teens' use of ADHD drugs up sharply . In addition, in order to properly identify a child affected by ADHD, Barbaresi, for example, conducts a medical and psychological assessment that takes several hours and requires the child and the parents to complete questionnaires about how the child responds to different situations, which factors seem to trigger hyperactive behavior or inattentiveness, as well as how disruptive these episodes are to the child's daily activities. Unfortunately, most insurers do not reimburse for such evaluations, and that pushes already busy doctors to take the path of least resistance -- prescribing medications such as Ritalin or Adderall. \"That's the big elephant in the room -- pediatricians and the family practitioner are being asked to sort out a complex situation in an inadequate amount of time without access to data from psychological assessments they need to make these fine distinctions,\" says Barbaresi. \"So it's a set-up for inappropriate decisions to be made.\" And those include not just mis-diagnosis and over-medication of children but mistreatment and even under-diagnosis in some situations. In rural and urban areas, where mental health services are scarcer and more stigmatized, rates of ADHD diagnoses are slightly lower than in affluent areas, and children in these areas are less likely to be treated properly. That could have implications for the long-term health of these children, since studies also show that about 60% of children with ADHD have a learning disability, and that 60% will go on to develop another mental illness by age 19. So a proper diagnosis of ADHD doesn't just provide opportunities to treat behavior problems, but potentially mental illnesses as well. That's why \"it's clearly inappropriate to do these superficial assessments,\" says Barbaresi. TIME.com: Nearly 1 in 4 who seek treatment don't have ADHD . Being too quick to diagnose the disorder also means doctors may be bypassing effective, non-drug treatments that may benefit many children, especially the youngest. The AAP recommends that children younger than 6 start with behavior therapy before beginning medications, but writing a prescription is far easier than monitoring a series of sessions that involve training and a commitment of time and effort from parents and family members. \"The problem we face is that behavioral, psychosocial and non-pharmacologic interventions are not sufficiently available to people,\" says Power. \"When I talk to pediatricians and primary care physicians, they tell me they don't want to be diagnosing ADHD as often as they are, and they don't want to be using medications as often as they are, but they don't have many other options available. It's difficult to get kids into mental health treatments and psychosocial treatments that they believe many of these children and their families need.\" These programs are designed to assess what factors trigger and sustain inappropriately impulsive and hyperactive behavior, he says, by involving parents and helping them to modify environmental factors or interactions with their children to modify their behavior. Playing and engaging more directly with children on a regular basis, for example, tends to calm them down, and setting limits and educating children about the consequences of their actions can also help. In groups that Power has conducted with his patients, parents have reported that such behavioral interventions are effective in improving children's relationships with their parents as well as with their teachers and classmates in school. But these programs don't work in a vacuum, and ideally, parents, doctors and teachers should coordinate their efforts to ensure that the appropriate behavior is being positively reinforced among children with ADHD. \"The best treatment is a combination of parent training, behavioral intervention, school interventions, and medication where needed,\" says Hughes. All too often, current therapies aren't taking advantage of the full power of this recipe. This article was initially published on TIME.com. Understanding the rise in ADHD diagnoses: 11% of U.S. children are affected .","output":"A recent report shows the rate of U.S. children with ADHD is rising .\nSome experts say it raises questions about whether we are overdiagnosing ADHD .\nAnd some children may be treated with medications they don't need, experts say .\nUnder-diagnosis may also be a problem in some areas ."}

If you're not sure what they are, ask your best friend.\" -- Stila Cosmetics founder Jeanine Lobell . 2. Brighten eyes . \"Smudge a bit of deep navy eyeliner on the inner rims of the upper lids when you're done with the rest of your eye makeup. Gently lifting lashes with your fingers or glancing down into a handheld mirror will help you see where the eyeliner is going. The blue color makes the whites of your eyes stand out.\"  -- Makeup artist Carmindy . 3. Fix blemishes . \"Mix together one packet of dry yeast with the juice of half a lemon and spread over a blemish for five minutes. This works wonderfully to dry it out.\" -- Esthetician Sonya Dakar . 4. Work your brows . \"Use ash-tone powders to fill in brows for natural-looking definition. The eyebrows provide a frame for the face, so it's important to keep them well groomed.\" -- Makeup artist Jillian Dempsey . 5. Tame flyaways . \"Carry dryer sheets; if frizzies threaten to ruin your look, run a sheet over your hair to subdue flyaway strands. When you need to take a model's photo fast, this trick really does work.\" -- Hairstylist Clyde Haygood . 6. Master nude lips . \"Line your lips with a neutral liner. Then fill in both lips -- except for the centers -- so that you can have the look of major shine when you apply a clear lip gloss.\" -- Makeup artist Mally Roncal . 7. Pop your peepers . \"Spotlight your eyes without being too obvious by blending a highlighter like Yves Saint Laurent's Touche \u00c9clat into the inner corners. Don't use shimmer powder, which can look too girly.\" -- Makeup artist AJ Crimson . 8. Lay a foundation . \"Concealer should always follow foundation. If you put it on first and then you blend on the foundation, you're essentially erasing all your handiwork. If you layer concealer on top, it's staying where it needs to stay and doing its job.\"  -- Carmindy . 9. Later, tired eyes! \"To perk up eyes in record time, dab under the eye area with aloe vera gel for temporary firming.\" -- Sonya Dakar . 10. Stroke differently . \"Utilize two kinds of mascaras -- coat the top lashes with a volumizing one to create thickness and the bottom ones with a waterproof formula to put raccoon eyes to rest.\" -- Jillian Dempsey . 11. Angle arches . \"To give your brows color, shine and great hold, take a little bit of MAC Oh Baby lip gloss and comb it through the eyebrows. A word of warning: Make sure you're wearing your hair pulled back!\"  -- Mally Roncal . 12. Pump your pout . \"For subtly fuller lips, overdraw the cupid's bow with Make Up For Ever's double-tipped concealer pencil in a shade lighter than your skin tone, soften the line by smudging and then gloss lips.\" -- AJ Crimson . 13. Heat up your hair . \"To maximize the benefit of a rich conditioner, leave it in and stand in a steamy shower for 10 minutes once a week. It's great to let the steam break down the conditioner -- and it's beneficial for your skin as well.\"  -- Hairstylist Kimberly Kimble . 14. Skip the cake(y) \"A lot of my celebrity clients like to mix my omega oils with their body foundation for a sheer, non-cakey finish.\" -- Sonya Dakar . 15. Lash out . \"Those with hard-to-reach blond lash roots can use a very fine-tip black liquid liner to accomplish what a bulkier mascara wand cannot by painting color directly onto individual lashes. The smaller the tip and the handle, the better.\"  -- Carmindy . 16. Draw the line . \"To make liquid liner less intimidating to use, create a liner 'stencil' by going over the lash line with taupe pencil first. Then apply liquid liner over that.\"   -- Jillian Dempsey . 17. Got silk? \"Silk scarves, rollers, bonnets and pillowcases used at night help my clients, like Gabrielle Union, maintain their glossy styles longer. Cotton dries hair out and undoes the hairstyle. Silk keeps the curl and shape of your hair intact.\" -- Kimberly Kimble . 18. Live in color . \"Bring attention to your eyes by using a contrasting shade of mascara. Wearing burgundy or navy instead of ordinary black or brown is a great way to accentuate your eye color.\"  -- Jillian Dempsey . 19. Soften up . \"To keep skin soft and smooth, especially in winter, avoid hot water in the bath and shower, and apply Burt's Bees Baby Bee Apricot Baby Oil to damp skin before slathering on a rich body cream. This will keep skin on all parts of the body nourished and glowing.\"  -- Sonya Dakar . 20. Get smoky eyes fast . \"I've done this trick to give Ashlee Simpson-Wentz a smoky eye in a pinch. Use a dark plum or deep green pencil all over the lid, inner rim and lower lash line and smudge it out with a cotton swab.\" -- Mally Roncal . 21. Smooth your strands . \"To care for end-of-summer hair, [clients like Evangeline Lilly] coat theirs midway down to the ends with a deep conditioner first, followed with a bodifying shampoo on the roots only.\" -- Clyde Haygood . 22. Stop smudges . \"For a quick, clean way to avoid mascara smudges, hold a plastic spoon under the upper and lower lashes to shield the rest of your eye makeup. It fits right under your eye, and you just throw it in the trash when you're done.\" -- Carmindy . 23.

Long before it was announced that William and Catherine had had a baby boy, speculation about what they'll call the newest addition to the royal family reached fever pitch. Would they pick a name that has already featured in that schoolroom poem? Read more: What will the royal baby look like? \"William and Kate are very much a couple of the 21st century but I think they will stick to traditional names, in keeping with the past,\" Kate's biographer Claudia Joseph told CNN. Whatever the pair pick as the all-important first name, there will be plenty of room to fit in nods to other members of the family too. \"Royals have quite a lot of names,\" said Williams. \"Charles is actually Charles Philip Arthur George, and the Queen is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary. Her father, Bertie, had five names.\" Writing for CNN, royal author Andrew Roberts agreed: \"Although we can't know what the child's name will be, we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them: Some heirs to the throne [have] had as many as seven or eight.\" But now we know it's a boy, Williams said the couple's choice was simpler in theory, since there are fewer traditionally \"royal\" male names to choose from. George and James are the current frontrunners with bookmakers, with odds of between 6\/4 and 11\/4. \"We're very fond of King Georges in this country,\" she said. Read more: Royal baby -- heir for a new century? But the peculiar British royal tradition of switching between names may complicate matters. Prince Charles is expected to be known as King George VII when he ascends to the throne; King George VI was actually christened Albert; and his brother, Edward VIII, who became  Duke of Windsor after his 1936 abdication, was known as David by family and friends. History has also knocked several male names out of the equation: Edward is unlikely, given that scandalous abdication so he could marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, and the various King Richards, Charleses and Johns are viewed as cruel, tyrannical or just downright unpopular. \"Charles, at 10\/1, and John, at 8\/1, are very unlikely,\" Roberts wrote. \"Charles is already taken as the name of Prince William's father, and John was one of the worst kings in British history.\" King John was forced to sign the Magna Carta by his nobles in 1215; he was portrayed as the key villain in \"Robin Hood.\" \"There's no way they would pick Edward as a first name,\" insists Williams. \"And you can't have Henry, after Henry VIII (though of course if Harry came to the throne he would be Henry). My bet is on George Philip William Edward.\" In recent years, there has been a move away from classic \"regal\" names by those on lower branches of the royal family tree. Prince Andrew and his now ex-wife Sarah \"Fergie\" Ferguson plumped for the unusual Beatrice and Eugenie for Prince William's cousins. Princess Anne, William's aunt, has two granddaughters by son Peter and Canadian daughter-in-law Autumn Phillips: Savannah (born in 2010) and Isla (born in 2012). Read more: Who can inherit British throne? But Joseph said William and Kate were always unlikely to go for more \"trendy\" options on the lists of popular names. In 2013, the most popular names for baby boys in the UK so far are Noah, Oscar and Oliver, according to babynames.co.uk. \"Obviously other members of the royal family have broken with tradition but the offspring of William and Kate will be a future monarch,\" she said. That means, says Williams, \"we're not going to see a Chardonnay, or a Plum, or an Apple.\" Nevertheless, British betting shops are more than happy to take your money if you fancy a flutter on a more modern or quirky moniker. If you think the future monarch might name a king-in-waiting after the King, you can always give it a shot: Ladbrokes are offering odds of 500\/1 in favor of Elvis, while the chances of the baby prince being named after South Korean rapper and YouTube sensation Psy are a long shot 5000\/1.

{"input":"(CNN) -- Faster than you can catch the red-eye from New York to London, the world's airlines have to keep evolving in order to stay resilient in the global world of commercial aviation. With 8 million passengers taking a plane each day, the 3 billion journeys made last year are more than just a flight for many. They are the hopes and dreams of deals to be done, families to be reunited and ambitions to be realized. The first commercial flight 100 years ago was a 23-minute journey in a flying boat across Tampa Bay, Florida in 1914. The Mayor of St. Petersburg, Florida, at that time paid $400 -- about $9,000 today -- to become the world's first paying passenger. Since the birth of commercial aviation the airline industry has been characterized by the concept of risk versus reward, with some of the best-known names failing, many merging and consolidating along the way. Pan American World Airways was one of the first to blaze a trail across the Atlantic with its spacious cabins, ladies-only powder rooms and modest overhead lights. But even for Pan Am it wasn't enough to keep the company financially astute. \"These names have gone, the Pan Ams and the British Caledonian and others, but of course their businesses went into other businesses, and that tells us that consolidation is the way forward in this industry,\" Tony Tyler, CEO of International Air Transport Association (IATA), told CNN's Richard Quest at the group's 70th AGM in Doha, Qatar. The industry has suffered as much turbulence in the pocket as it has in the air, and American Airlines is another example of risk versus reward. After its recent bankruptcy, it was the last major U.S. carrier to merge, with U.S. Airways. There's no better example of risk and reward than the Boeing 747, the Jumbo Jet. The world's first wide-bodied, double decker plane, it was built by Boeing in the 1960s, which literally bet the company on the plane's success. According to Tyler, a key to success in the future is sticking to a global mindset. \"The point is this is a global industry, it's become global over the last 100 years,\" he told Quest. \"We are the industry that makes global possible and what that means is that everyone in it needs to understand they are part of a global network. They're part of a global system and they need to think globally in everything they do.\" While today's airplanes are a century away from that flying boat that crossed Tampa Bay, there's no doubt that the risk and reward still remain just as high as they did 100 years ago.

{"input":"Friday 13th lived up to its chilling reputation today for two separate groups of hot air balloonists - after their craft blew off course. One stray balloon narrowly avoided tragedy after blowing into power lines in North Yorkshire, while another caused chaos at Gatwick Airport by straying into the path of departing flights. Amazingly nobody was hurt - but they will prompt some people to question if superstitions about the unluckiest day of the year are true after all. A Hot air balloon with 9 passengers and one pilot collided with 66,000 volt power lines in North Yorkshire today . The stricken balloon hangs over power lines after coming down . The balloon crash landed perilously close to a pond . Nine passengers and a pilot were onboard the balloon that crashed into cables carrying 66,000 volts of electricity as it attempted to land near Selby, North Yorkshire at 8.15am. The power automatically shut down . after the collision and the people in the basket, which crashed to the . ground just feet from a large pond, were able to scramble to safety. Part of the blue and yellow balloon was hanging over the power line and . in the water as emergency teams arrived at the crash site. The Air Accident Investigation Branch has launched an investigation have interviewed the pilot, John Russell. Mr Russell, who has 25 years\u2019 experience, said he was trying to land at . an arranged location and was coming down at 3mph, when a 20mph gust of . wind blew the balloon 200 metres across an embankment and into power . lines beside a pond. He said: \u201cI have never had anything like this happen in 25 years - but what day is it today? - Friday the 13th.\u201d A spokeswoman said engineers were . attempting to remove the balloon from the lines before repairs can . begin, but the supply in that section of the cables had been isolated . and there had been no power disruption to homes in the area. Suspended: Five flights were delayed at Gatwick this morning by the drifting balloon (file photo) The balloon was being operated by . Balloon Rides, a subsidiary of Hampshire-based Adventure Balloons which . runs flights in Yorkshire. A spokeswoman for Adventure Balloons said: \u201cOn landing, there was an . increase in the surface winds and the balloon caught the wire, but there . were no injuries and minor damage to the balloon.\u201d Just 45 minutes after the balloon . came down in Yorkshire, a second craft was spotted drifting into the flightpath at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport. No planes were able to take off for a . little under half an hour while police and air traffic controllers . searched for the balloon in thick fog. A Gatwick spokesman said: 'The airport is not closed and arrival flights are . still landing, but departing flights were suspended for safety reasons.'

The president and his supporters are pushing to get higher wages for American workers, but the nation's largest pro-Obama organizing group is telling its footsoldiers not to expect a paycheck at all. Organizing For Action, which flexed its muscles as Obama For America during two presidential election campaigns, announced Wednesday that it's seeking 'Spring Organizing Fellows' to 'be a part of our growing organization' and 'explor[e] OFA's broad scope approach to issue advocacy.' But unlike most fellowships, which offer a stipend or a housing allowance, the positions are strictly 'unpaid' and require Americans to work 'without the expectation of pay, for civic and public service purposes.' Organizing For Action collected $7.7 million during the third quarter of 2013, according to disclosure reports collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. The group has raised nearly $21 million this year. President Obama's election machine is now called 'Organizing For Action,' and it's looking for free labor while it pushes for a minimum wage hike . On Wednesday President Obama railed on against big-business efforts to block a minimum-wage hike, while his wealthy campaign machine pushed for free labor to do his bidding . An hour before OFA announced its 2014 fellowship program, the group tweeted a line from the president's Wednesday speech on the economy. 'Retweet if you agree: \"It's well past the time to raise the minimum wage.\" \u2014President Obama,' the group's message read. Three hours later the Twitter account @BarackObama, which OFA controls, blasted out an infographic that claimed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would create 140,000 new jobs. And the group's website advocates for policies that 'reward work by raising the minimum wage so an honest day\u2019s work pays more.' In a lengthy economic policy speech on Wednesday, the president complained that 'there are airport workers, and fast-food workers, and nurse assistants, and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty.' 'And that\u2019s why it\u2019s well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office.' 'Wage slaves'? Fast food workers are picketing McDonald's restaurants in New York City today, as part of the union-led social movement that Organization For Action supports . Thousands marched in front of Walmarts on Black Friday, demanding higher wages for employees. Unions paid some protesters to show up; Walmart hasn't budged on its wage policies or its decision to avoid unionizing its workforce . 'For all their talk of fairness and justice, supporters of minimum wage hikes hypocritically fail to offer these exact same policies to their own employee interns,' Employment Policies Institute research director Michael Saltsman told MailOnline. 'It\u2019s a classic case of \"do what I say, not what I do.\"' Organizing For Action did not respond to a request for comment. The group has operated fellowship programs for several years, including the two presidential election cycles when it was the official Obama campaign organization. But in those days, throngs of volunteers flocked to 'fellowship' meetings to learn how they could help elect, and then re-elect, Barack Obama. In the president's second term, however, OFA has found it tougher to recruit cost-free labor. June 2012: Hundreds of OFA volunteer 'fellows' packed a hall in Virginia to learn how they could help re-elect President Obama . Trouble in paradise, May 2013: An OFA organizer proudly tweeted a picture of just two 'fellows' building a climate-change database for OFA . 'Look,' a Republican election consultant told MailOnline, 'Obamacare is in the trash heap, Iran is about to have a nuclear bomb, the IRS and Justice Department are as corrupt as a New Jersey mobster, and the White House has become a punchline.' 'No wonder the volunteers are staying home.' Online photos from 2010 and earlier show hundreds of 'fellows' gathered in meeting rooms to receive their marching orders. More recent images circulating on Twitter and Facebook show tiny handfuls of volunteers engaged in defending the president and his policy objectives. Anti-Obama partisans lashed out on Wednesday after OFA launched its search for unpaid workers. 'Do you provide a living wage to do this work?' one asked. Another quipped: 'Only if you pay me $15 per hour, plus benefits. Otherwise you are exploiting my labor.'","output":"Organizing For Action, known as Obama For America during the election season, is advertising for 'fellowships' to push the White House's agenda .\nUnlike most fellowships, the positions are unpaid and provide no benefits .\nOFA advocates for minimum-wage hikes, but is catching flak for denying its own footsoldiers any wages at all .\nConservatives tweeted barbs on Wednesday as OFA announced its program just hours after Obama demanded a minimum wage increase ."}
{"input":"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 3:18 AM on 2nd March 2012 . A senior Labour MP has claimed expenses from the taxpayer for attending Remembrance Day services in his constituency. Adrian Bailey, who earns more than \u00a380,000, claimed \u00a313 to attend three separate services in his West Bromwich constituency in November last year. Mr Bailey, chairman of the powerful Commons business, innovation and skills committee, also claimed \u00a33.15 to attend the launch of a local poppy appeal in Tipton the previous month. In the wrong? Adrian Bailey's (pictured in dark shades) claims on expenses for attending a remembrance service at West Bromwich Town Hall is in poor taste . The claims are permitted under Parliament\u2019s supposedly tough new expenses rules and were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). But Mr Bailey\u2019s decision to claim mileage expenses for attending events that many consider a civic duty is likely to raise eyebrows. Figures published yesterday reveal that he claimed \u00a32.70 in mileage for a six-mile round trip to attend the remembrance service at West Bromwich town hall. He then claimed \u00a34.95 for an 11-mile round trip to the service at Wednesbury British Legion. Finally, he claimed a further \u00a35.40 for a 12-mile round trip to a service at Wood Green cemetery. Mr Bailey is a senior figure on Labour\u2019s backbenches and is paid \u00a314,500 on top of his MPs\u2019 salary in recognition of his role as a select committee chairman. Excessive? Ed Balls claimed over \u00a3155 for a taxi fare into London last year . Despite his generous salary, the new figures suggest he is scrupulous about claiming his expenses, however small. On two occasions in November he claimed \u00a32.25 for \u2018tea and cake\u2019, while on another he charged the taxpayer \u00a33.35 for \u2018cake, apple, coffee and two plums\u2019. Mr Bailey was invited to comment last night but did not respond. The figures were included in the latest batch of expenses data from Ipsa. In the two months of October and November last year Ipsa processed \u00a33.5 million in expenses claims from MPs. Notable claims include a \u00a3155.65 taxi fare submitted by the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls when he returned to London for the recall of Parliament following the riots in August last year. Aides last night Mr Balls was forced to get a taxi from Gatwick Airport to his north London home after catching a late flight home from a foreign holiday. Transport Secretary Justine Greening submitted two 10p claims for bus fares, although an aide stressed that the claims related to travel expenses for an intern working in her office. The aide pointed that Miss Greening did not claim for her own travel around her constituency in Putney, London. In total, MPs claimed for more than \u00a392,000 in mileage during the two-month period. Critics argue that the ability of MPs to claim 40p a mile in mileage cushions them from the pain caused to ordinary motorists by soaring fuel prices. MPs also claimed \u00a311,352, for taxis, despite a supposed ban in all but exceptional circumstances.","output":"Adrian Bailey earns more than \u00a380,000 .\nHe also claimed \u00a32.25 for 'tea and cake'\n... and charged taxpayer \u00a33.35 for 'cake, apple, coffee and two plums'"}

This is followed by Stockport in Greater Manchester, with 27.2 per cent and Walsall, in the West Midlands, at 26.5 per cent. The figures come from a study of 3,000 town centres and retail parks by Local Data Company. The vacancy rate in the North West - the worst-hit area - is 16.9 per cent. It has risen in the last year by 0.4 per cent in the North East to 16.4 per cent. In contrast, London's vacancy is 7.9 per cent.

Matthew Hopkinson, of Local Data Company, told the\u00a0Sunday Mirror: 'Of the top 10 worst town centres for vacant retail and leisure premises, all of which are above 23 per cent, six are in the North East or North West. 'Of the top 10 best-performing town centres with the least vacant units, seven are in London and the South East.' He added: 'People have to realise these town centres are not going back to pre-2008 levels and accept at least 20 per cent of shops there are no longer required. They have got to create smaller centres that pull viable businesses into a vibrant core.' The British Retail Consortium said the way rates are set is unfair on high street shops and has called for a reform of the business rates system. It said retailers pay \u00a37billion a year - which is \u00a3500million more than three years ago. Another problem for high street shops is that more than 10 per cent of retail spending is now online, while many shoppers go to out-of-town retail parks to avoid pricey town centre parking charges. 'Portas Towns' got \u00a3100,000 \u00adgovernment grants . In 2012 TV guru Mary Portas was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres. The businesswoman and presenter was hired to turn around town centres in places like Bedford, Dartford and Margate, with a share of a \u00a31.2million fund. The first 12 Portas Pilot towns were Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. They were promised an injection of life, with more markets, better branding and pop-up shops. Ideas included \u2018guerilla gardening\u2019, street art, town criers and bicycle rickshaw services. However, many of her main recommendations including free parking and cheaper business rates were not taken up by ministers. She also faced criticism for the review with some calling it 'too nostalgic' and a 'PR stunt'. Since the dark ages, governments have used a tax on residential and commercial property to pay for local services. But store groups are struggling to keep their costs and prices down to fend off competition from online rivals. The problem is not so much the imbalance in the amount of corporation tax paid by the likes of Amazon and Starbucks - compared with their UK-domiciled rivals - but business rates. At a time when online sales are rising fast and traditional retailers are struggling, business rates are effectively a tax on the high street. Internet retailers pay zero in terms of business rates because they have no bricks and mortar stores - in other words, high street buildings. However, the traditional store chains find they are seeing profits fall but are paying a lot more in business rates. The unfairness has become a hot political issue and it is a key topic being discussed at the Labour Party conference in Manchester last week. Labour wants a 1 per cent cut in business rates if it wins the 2015 General Election. This is worth around \u00a31billion. More than 100 business leaders have called for the changes.","output":"One in three shops in high streets lie empty despite economic recovery .\nRetailers put this down to out-of-town supermarkets, online shopping, expensive parking and high business rates .\nThe figures also highlight the severity of the North-south wealth divide .\nHartlepool, in County Durham, has the worst vacancy rate in the UK ."}

A man who attacked his pregnant girlfriend and tried to push her over a banister when he 'saw red' escaped jail after the court heard how he struggled to cope with stressful situations. Edward Gaunt, 20, slapped Sarah Bolland, held a knife to her stomach and threatened to harm her unborn child during a series of rows last December. But despite labelling his crimes 'appalling', a judge handed Gaunt a suspended sentence, allowing him to walk free from court. No longer together: Edward Gaunt attacked his then girlfriend Sarah Bolland when she was pregnant . The . most vicious of his assaults was sparked when his girlfriend demanded . to know if Gaunt had been taking drugs, and looked at his arms for . needle marks, a hearing at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court was told. The court heard how Gaunt had been in a five-year 'on-off' relationship with Miss Bolland, which had featured some violent episodes. Sarah Haslam, prosecuting, said Gaunt seemed happy about his partner's pregnancy until the night of December 27 last year, when he 'saw red' and attacked her. Gaunt, 20, struck both sides of her head with his hand and pulled her to the floor.\u00a0 He then tried to push her over a banister rail and spat at her as she walked downstairs. Mrs Haslam said trouble flared again at 10am the next day after Ms Bolland asked if he was using amphetamine. The court heard she looked for needle marks on his arm and he became angry. Mrs Haslam said: 'He hit her around the head many times and he grabbed her throat. He knelt on her stomach and slapped her across the face. The judge told Gaunt, pictured left, that he had behaved in a 'vicious and malicious' way towards Miss Bolland . 'He pushed a sharp knife against her stomach, saying he would put it through her and her baby.' She added: 'He said: \"I hope you will ring me later and give me some good news that the baby has died\".' Gaunt, from Buxton, Derbyshire, was arrested and claimed that Ms Bolland was 'spiteful and hormonal' and that she had made up the allegations. He appeared in court in custody, having been on remand in Nottingham prison for 24 days, and admitted the assaults at Buxton. 'It was appalling treatment of someone carrying your child. It beggars belief,' Deputy District Judge Andrew Davison told him. He said Gaunt had behaved in a 'vicious and malicious' way and had been wrongly charged with common assault when he should have faced the more serious offence of assault causing actual bodily harm. Mr Davison imposed a 20-week jail term but suspended it for two years. He ordered Gaunt to pay \u00a3500 compensation to Ms Bolland, who suffered bruising to her head. A restraining order, banning Gaunt from contacting her for an indefinite period, was also imposed, plus a two-year probation supervision order, including drug treatment and domestic abuse programmes. Defending, Rebecca Wrack said: 'He deeply regrets his behaviour and doesn't seek to excuse it. The relationship has now come to an end and she has moved out of the area.' She told the court a friend of Gaunt had died a week before the offence. He struggled to cope with stressful situations and he took amphetamine and reacted badly when confronted about it.","output":"Edward Gaunt, 20, of Buxton, knelt on Sarah Bolland's stomach in row .\nJudge gives 20-week suspended sentence, restraining and supervision orders .\nGaunt was also told to pay Miss Bolland \u00a3500 compensation for bruising ."}

{"input":"By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 12:14 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:33 EST, 25 September 2013 . Some commonly prescribed statins can impair memory, scientists have found . Statins taken by millions of Britons could lead to\u00a0 memory loss, researchers have warned. In tests, one of the widely- prescribed drugs cut the ability to form new memories and recall information. The medication, called pravastatin, was found to have an adverse effect on rats. Bristol University researchers say their study tallies with reports of statin patients feeling \u2018fuzzy-headed\u2019 and \u2018befuddled\u2019. The team also said it was \u2018highly likely\u2019 other statins affected memory loss. But other experts dismissed the research and insisted the benefits of statins outweigh any side-effects. Statins, which lower levels of \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol in the blood, are the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain and are taken by up to eight million people. Used to treat those at risk of heart problems and strokes, they are credited with saving thousands of lives a year and some doctors believe that everyone over the age of 50 should be given them. However, a range of documented side-effects includes muscle and liver problems, blurred vision, fatigue and difficulty sleeping, leading some\u00a0 doctors to argue they should be reserved only for those at risk of heart problems. The Bristol neuroscientists looked at the effect of two of the most commonly prescribed statins \u2013 pravastatin and atorvastatin \u2013 on the memory of rats. Rodents given pravastatin found it more difficult to learn where a sugary treat was hidden, they discovered. They also struggled to recall an object they had seen before. This behaviour was likened by researchers to someone knowing that they have car keys, but not being able to remember where they left them. It is thought statins may be reducing levels of cholesterol in the brain or affecting its nerve cells directly. A quarter of the body\u2019s cholesterol is found inside the head, where it aids the transmission of signals between brain cells. The . problems vanished shortly after the animals were taken off pravastatin. Atorvastatin did not affect memory, according to a report in the . journal PLoS ONE. It is . unclear why pravastatin affected memory, as the drug is not thought to . be able to cross into the brain and atorvastatin is. Pravastatin (pictured), with the brand name Pravachol, has adverse effects on working and recognition memory. However, atorvastatin, with the brand name Lipitor, does not have any effect . The . Bristol researchers said patients on statins should take note of the . findings and warned that it is \u2018highly likely\u2019 other statins may also . affect memory. Professor . Neil Marrion said: \u2018If you notice you are suffering cognitive problems . or people around you\u00a0 recognise you are suffering problems, go back to . your GP and ask for a different statin and you might find the problem . disappears.\u2019 Others have described the advice as \u2018total overkill\u2019. Consultant . cardiologist Kausik Ray, a member of the British Cardiovascular . Society, said large-scale studies on frail and elderly people had failed . to find any evidence that statins damage memory. \u2018I don\u2019t do rat research, I do large-scale population research,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is a reason that people are on statins \u2013 and that is to reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes.\u2019 The . drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency . (MHRA), said memory loss is already listed as a potential side-effect . of statins. A spokesman . added: \u2018The benefits of statins are well established and outweigh the . risk of side-effects in most patients who take them. We are aware of . this study and, as with all medicines, the safety of statins continues . to be monitored closely.\u2019","output":"Pravastatin, with the brand name Pravachol, has been found to impair\u00a0memory .\nAtorvastatin, with the brand name Lipitor, does not, say Bristol researchers .\nThe adverse effects of pravastatin on memory can be reversed by stopping the medication ."}
{"input":"(CNN) -- \"Media must cease reporting on the discovery of a body at a psychiatric hospital in Dongguan.\" \"Media must not report on corruption allegations relating to the eldest son of President Hu Jintao.\" \"Media must not report on a lawsuit against China Eastern Airlines by victims of a plane crash in 2004 in which 52 passengers were killed.\" Those are just a few of more than 60 restrictions the Chinese government slapped on the media in 2009, often secretly, according to the International Federation of Journalists. The press freedom group said it obtained written media-related orders which are published in its report, \"China Clings to Control: Press Freedoms in 2009.\" Tight controls were put on reporting of ethnic riots in the west of the country in July, and clear orders were issued for how to report President Barack Obama's visit to the country in November, the IFJ said in the report released Sunday. The press was instructed not to organize questions for the public to ask Obama at a town-hall style event he did in the country and was banned from reporting on \"protests or spontaneous news during Obama's visit,\" the IFJ report said. It all added up to a year of increased censorship in China, on the heels of a period of relative openness around the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the group charged. CNN's calls to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington were not immediately returned. The IFJ report said that Chinese media were ordered not to report prominently on protests in Iran following the country's controversial presidential election in June. They were barred from reporting at all on elections for the chief executive of Macau, a region of China, and were waved off stories about refugees entering China, threats to public health, political protests and corruption, the report said. They were allowed to report about some stories in English but not Mandarin, and others in newspapers but not online, said the report, which was compiled with the help of a group called Chinese Human Rights Defenders. That's not to mention self-censorship in the press around two key anniversaries last year: the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests and the Tibetan uprising of 1959, the IFJ said. \"Media did not need to be ordered how to report these matters -- they were very aware there was to be no independent reporting on these topics,\" the report said. \"Most journalists and media outlets would self-censor and there would be no need for regulations or orders... self-censorship remains a matter of self-preservation.\" Direct orders from the government -- sometimes containing the explicit threat of \"punishment from the Central Propaganda Department\" -- was only one element in Beijing's arsenal against the press, the report said. China is clearly concerned about the Internet, the IFJ suggested. \"Online surveillance was stepped up, Web sites were entirely or partially closed, online social networks were shut down, online news portals were censored, online journalists and bloggers were detained and arrested.\" Press \"accreditation rules tightened further in 2009... making it difficult for online journalists to gain accreditation,\" the report said. And foreign journalists encountered \"acts of violence, destruction of work materials and equipment... surveillance and reprimands,\" the report said. But \"despite the difficulties, many journalists try to go out of the way to get the news,\" the IFJ said. China hosted a World Media Summit in October, drawing the heads of some of the world's largest news organizations, including the Associated Press, Reuters, News Corporation, Russia's Itar-Tass, Kyodo of Japan and China's own Xinhua. President Hu addressed the conference, saying \"it is more important than ever before that the media should establish and uphold social responsibilities,\" according to Xinhua. Hu pledged the Chinese government would safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of foreign news media and continue to facilitate foreign media coverage of China in accordance with the law, Xinhua reported. It is not clear that he made a similar promise regarding Chinese media. Obama criticized censorship in his November visit to China, responding to questions from the Chinese public about restrictions on the Internet. \"Because in the United States information is free, and I have a lot of critics in the United States who can say all kinds of things about me, I actually think that that makes our democracy stronger and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that I don't want to hear,\" he said. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on China to investigate alleged hacking of Google in the country -- prompting the Internet search giant to threaten to pull out of China. \"We look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent,\" Clinton said. Five years ago, Google agreed to allow some censorship by China, in exchange for the right to operate in that country's massive emerging technology market. The company now says censorship and the hacking of Chinese dissidents' Google e-mail accounts have prompted it to reconsider. The IFJ calls itself \"a non-governmental, non-profit organization that promotes coordinated international action to defend press freedom and social justice through the development of strong, free and independent trade unions of journalists.\"","output":"Press group notes more than 60 government restrictions on media in 2009 .\nReport: Press was told not to organize questions for public to ask Obama during visit .\nChinese media barred from reporting on elections for chief executive in Macau, report says .\nCNN's calls to Chinese Foreign Ministry, Embassy in Washington not returned ."}
{"input":"Rebekah Brooks: The former News of the World editor was acquitted of being part of the hacking conspiracy\u00a0following a 139-day trial at the Old Bailey . News International has dropped an application for costs incurred in relation to the multimillion-pound phone hacking trial of Rebekah Brooks and her staff, a court has heard. The former News of the World editor was acquitted of being part of the hacking conspiracy along with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 50, and News International head of security Mark Hanna, 51, following a 139-day trial. Today, at the start of a costs hearing, the Old Bailey heard that News International, now known as News UK, will not proceed with the application to have its considerable costs repaid so as not to come under further scrutiny from the court. Robert Smith QC, representing News UK, said: \u2018It is submitted that the allegations against News UK on the basis of apparently reliable evidence produced during the trial, News UK had failed to displace after being given a proper opportunity to do so. \u2018The fact nevertheless remains that we would like to bring to the court\u2019s attention the sheer scale of that exercise which has troubled us, your lordship, throughout. \u2018It is following that that News UK have indicated that they have not felt willing to engage in an exercise which involves addressing these issues in these proceedings. \u2018The end result is that News UK would not seek or accept any part of any order by way of costs from central funds, public funds or however one wishes to express it.\u2019 Jonathan Laidlaw QC, representing Brooks, 46, said she had already made clear she did not intend to recover her personal expenses incurred during the case. Long trial:\u00a0Brooks was acquitted of being part of the hacking conspiracy along with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter (left), 50, and News International head of security Mark Hanna (right), 51 . He told the court: \u2018Having been the beneficiary of an indemnity for her legal costs from News, as my learned friend Mr Smith has correctly indicated, any monies which would have been the subject of a claims case order would have automatically gone to News to compensate them for the financial support they were good enough to afford to her during her trial. \u2018I formally withdraw the application on her behalf. Mrs Brooks has already indicated that she was not seeking and did not wish to recover her personal expenses for the trial from the public purse.\u2019 Her husband, Charlie Brooks, 51, and retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 74, were also found not guilty of being part of the hacking conspiracy, which dates back to 2000, but are continuing to seek their costs, the court heard. Racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, who attended the hearing, is seeking ballpark costs of \u00a3600,000, the court heard. Continuing to seek their costs: Brooks's husband, Charlie Brooks (left), 51, and retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner (right), 74, whow ere also found not guilty of being part of the hacking conspiracy . Jonathan Caplan QC, representing Kuttner, said he paid out \u2018from his own pocket a little less than \u00a3135,000\u2019 until News UK indemnified him from January 2013 onwards. Rebekah Brooks was cleared of hacking, conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office for allegedly signing off payments to a Sun journalist\u2019s \u2018number one military contact\u2019 between 2004 and 2012, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice. Her husband was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice around the time of police searches in July 2011, while Kuttner was also cleared of hacking. Carter was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice by removing seven boxes from the NI archive days before she was arrested in 2011 while Hanna was cleared of perverting the course of justice around the time of police searches in July 2011. The court heard that prosecutors may have been led to believe their case was stronger than it was by how the defendants behaved both before and after their arrest. Mr Caplan said the answer to this in respect of Kuttner was a \u2018resounding no\u2019. Decision: News International has dropped an application for costs incurred in relation to the multimillion-pound phone hacking trial of Mrs Brooks and her staff. The firm's old offices in Wapping, east London, are pictured . \u2018Mr Kuttner was one of the few who gave full answers to very lengthy interview sessions with police,\u2019 he said. He also pointed out that Kuttner had alerted police to a message on murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler\u2019s mobile phone, not realising that the method of obtaining the information - though phone hacking - may have constituted a crime. Neil Saunders, representing Charlie Brooks, said his actions \u2018may have been unwise, but not criminal\u2019. Referring to the fact that Mr Brooks answered \u2018no comment\u2019 when questioned by police, Mr Saunders said: \u2018He clearly brought suspicion on himself. But it has to be something more than a \u2018no comment\u2019.\u2019 Ahead of listening to the legal argument, the judge, Mr Justice Saunders, told the court to remember that the defendants had been cleared by a jury. \u2018I have the greatest respect for the system and the greatest respect for the jury\u2019s decision in this case and nothing under discussion should be seen as going against this,\u2019 he said. \u2018The defendants have been found innocent.\u2019 The judge is expected to announce his ruling on the costs application tomorrow.","output":"Ex-NotW editor acquitted of being part of hacking conspiracy after trial .\nAlso acquitted were her former personal assistant and head of security .\nCompany does not want to come under further scrutiny from the court .\nBut Charlie Brooks and Stuart Kuttner\u00a0are continuing to seek their costs ."}
{"input":"(CNN) -- The girlfriend of James \"Whitey\" Bulger was sentenced to eight years in federal prison Tuesday for identity fraud and helping the reputed mob boss avoid capture for 16 years. Catherine Greig, who prosecutors said was Bulger's \"partner\" in avoiding capture, must also pay a $150,000 fine, U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled. Greig, 61, declined to speak before her sentencing, but her lawyer said afterward that she has no regrets. \"She was in love with the guy and lived with him for 16 years,\" J.W. Carney said. \"Of course she doesn't regret it.\" Bulger and Greig were captured at their Santa Monica, California, apartment a year ago. He faces trial later this year, accused of committing 19 murders during a reign of terror in South Boston during the 1970s and 1980s. The clues that led to the Bulgers' capture . Greig pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud and conspiracy to commit identity fraud. Federal prosecutors, calling it \"the most extreme case\" of harboring a fugitive, asked the judge to give her 10 years in prison. \"She not only hid his identity, but also hid the fact Bulger had filled their apartment with weapons, enabling Bulger to avoid capture by violence if necessary,\" prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. Woodlock, before imposing the sentence in U.S. District Court in Boston, said Greig had to pay a price for her bad choices. He suggested she could show that she was making better choices by cooperating with prosecutors in the case against Bulger. Her lawyer made it clear outside of the courthouse that she would not become a government witness because she feels \"the love of her life\" is innocent. \"She doesn't buy that, doesn't believe it, and absolutely stands by her man,\" Carney said. Stephen Rakes, who says his South Boston liquor store was taken over by Bulger, was one of the victims who spoke in court before the sentencing. He said he thought Greig should have been given the maximum 15 years in prison. \"She has no heart,\" Rakes said after the sentencing. \"She probably sleeps in an ice chest.\" Bulger, who is being held without bail, was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. He evaded law enforcement for 16 years before he and Greig were arrested in June 2011 in Santa Monica.

{"input":"Paris (CNN) -- A furnace exploded Monday at a nuclear site in France, killing one person and injuring four, a spokeswoman for French energy company EDF told CNN. There was no radioactive leak or waste released, she said. The French nuclear safety agency also said there had been no radioactive leak. The explosion happened at a center for processing and decommissioning nuclear waste, said the safety agency, which is known by its French acronym ASN. The agency has sent inspectors to the site, it said in a statement. The explosion took place in Marcoule, in southeastern France, the EDF spokeswoman said, declining to give her name in line with company policy. The building housing the furnace was not structurally damaged by the explosion, an official at the plant said. Different activities take place at the large-scale site, including research by France's Center for Atomic Energy, said a spokeswoman for Areva, a nuclear company that has operations at Marcoule. Areva dismantles nuclear facilities at the site, she said. There are no nuclear power plants in Marcoule, the spokeswoman said, declining to give her name. Weapons-grade plutonium was once produced at the site, one of the oldest nuclear facilities in the country, but France no longer produces plutonium. The location is not far from the Cote du Rhone wine region. Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the United States said he does not know of any comparable facilities there, but he said the incident in France shows that processing even low-level nuclear waste carries some risk. The incident could affect the debate over what the U.S. does with its spent nuclear fuel, said Lyman of the nuclear watchdog group. Currently, nuclear plants store the fuel in pools and in dry casks. Some say that it should be processed for reuse, as is done in France. But Lyman said that reprocessing creates large amounts of low-level waste and that Monday's incident shows the risk of dealing with even that kind of waste. France relies heavily on nuclear power, which now accounts for about 80% of the country's electricity production, according to the U.S. State Department. The French government has been reviewing the country's dependence on nuclear energy after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan in March 2011, which was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. There have been no serious suggestions from mainstream politicians that France reduce its dependence on nuclear power, the State Department says. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam, Saskya Vandoorne, Jim Bittermann, Mike Ahlers and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","output":"NEW: The blast could affect the U.S. debate about spent nuclear fuel, an expert says .\nA furnace explodes at the Marcoule nuclear site in southeastern France .\nThere is no radioactive leak, electricity company EDF says .\nFrance relies on nuclear power for about 80% of its energy ."}
{"input":"A Seattle hip-hop artist has apparently shot himself dead after writing a series of tragic Twitter messages detailing his misery and how he was going to kill himself. Freddy E, 22, died on Saturday from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The King County medical examiner's office said an autopsy would be performed on Monday to confirm the cause. Before his death, the performer, who was born Frederick Eugene Buhl, tweeted a long string of messages, beginning with: 'Annnd, my day is ruined.' 'If there's a God then He's calling me . back home. This barrel never felt so good next to my dome. It's cold . & I'd rather die than live alone,' he tweeted. 'It's... all... bad... y'all. *puts finger around trigger*' Tragic: Hip hop artist Freddy E died from an apparent self-inflicted gun shot wound on Saturday after a writing desperate tweets. One of his fans posted this picture of him brandishing a gun, right, to Facebook . Freddy E, who uploaded pictures to his Twitter account showing him partying on the day of his death, then told his family members that he loved them before posting his final tweet: 'I'm sorry.' While investigations into his death continue, MTV reported that many fans were accusing Toronto rapper Honey Cocaine for causing the heartbreak that led Freddy E to take his life. Cocaine, who herself was shot last year after a show in Nebraska, took to Twitter to argue that there was a connection between their relationship and his suicide. 'To say I caused what happened is ignorance,' she wrote. 'You know nothing about our . friendship or the story, hate me if you feel. We loved each other. We . were homies. We had a bond and a connection. Final messages: Freddy E wrote a series of tragic tweets on Saturday before apparently taking his life . 'For people to attack me . acting like I made him do it is a shame. I said . some foolish things cause I thought he was joking, he does shit like . that to me all the time. This is crazy..' Honey Cocaine, whose real name is Sochitla Sal, also tweeted a picture of text messages she exchanged with Freddy E on Saturday. 'I feel like everyone is out to get me. Is it true?' he wrote. She . responded: 'The devil is always out to get you in different forms...Anything revolving around money is intertwined with evil. Play your cards right and keep your soul pure cuz you can be a victim in a second.' While the exact nature of their friendship is not known, he praised her on his Facebook page late last month and described how they were in constant contact. 'Love': Some fans said he took his life over a failed relationship with Toronto rapper Honey Cocaine, pictured, yet she called the claims 'ignorance' and maintained they were good friends . 'I talk to Honey damn near every day,' he wrote. 'I text her. She calls me. We talk on the phone for hours. I've met some of her family and she's met some of mine. We call each . other by our birth names. I'd take a bullet for her, as would she take . one for me. I actually know her.' On a video posted earlier this month, he added: 'Honey, you're one amazing individual. Someone doesn't have to be in your life very long for them to leave a huge impact, and she definitely did that. 'She's beautiful, ambitious, passionate about her craft. Seriously... I love that girl.' As fans flocked to his Facebook page to pay their respects, Freddy E's family did the same.

{"input":"More than 1,000 veterans may have died in the last decade because of malpractice or lack of care from Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, a new report issued by the office of Sen. Tom Coburn finds. The report aggregates government investigations and media reports to trace a history of fraudulent scheduling practices, budget mismanagement, insufficient oversight and lack of accountability that have led to the current controversy plaguing the VA. The VA has admitted that 23 patients have died because of delayed care in recent years, but the report, titled \"Friendly Fire: Death, Delay, and Dismay at the VA,\" shows many more patient deaths have been linked to systemic issues affecting VA hospitals and clinics throughout the U.S. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and physician, says that if the VA's budget had been properly handled and the right management had been in place, many of these deaths could have been avoided. \"Over the past decade, more than 1,000 veterans may have died as a result of VA malfeasance,\" said Coburn, a three-time cancer survivor who says the government should offer veterans access to private hospitals. \"Poor management is costing the department billions of dollars more and compromising veterans' access to medical care,\" he said. Since November 2013, CNN has been reporting on how veterans wait excessive periods for VA health care, causing some to die in the process. Coburn's office says the VA has allocated about $20 billion since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to numerous non-health-related projects, such as office makeovers, unused software licenses, undocumented purchases on government debit cards and the funding of call centers that received an average of 2.4 calls per day, among others. In 2013, four VA construction projects in Las Vegas, Orlando, Denver and New Orleans cost an extra $1.5 billion because of scheduling delays and excessive expenditures, the report shows. Additional funds have been funneled into legal settlements. Since 2001, the VA has paid about $845 million in malpractice costs, of which $36.4 million was used to settle claims involving delayed health care. Criticism of the VA's budget has increased in light of a controversial performance bonus system that allegedly created financial incentives for managers to hide the fact that patients were waiting months for care. At a congressional hearing Friday, Gina Farrisee, the VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, confirmed that 78% of VA senior managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013, despite ongoing delay and malpractice controversies. Former VA Regional Director Michael Moreland received a $63,000 bonus in 2013 for infection prevention policies, for example, but the VA's Office of Inspector General concluded that his policies failed. Moreland presided over the Pittsburgh VA, where an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease killed six veterans in 2011 and 2012. The report identifies crimes committed by VA staff, including drug dealing, theft and sexual abuse of patients dating back many years. Earlier this year, one former staffer at the Tampa, Florida, VA was sentenced to six years in federal prison for trading veterans' personal information for crack cocaine. A CNN investigation recently uncovered an additional scheme at the Phoenix VA hospital, where records of dead veterans were changed to hide how many died while waiting for care. The VA's inspector general is investigating 69 medical centers for allegations that administrators altered appointment data to make patient wait times appear to be shorter. A letter released Monday by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel rebuked the VA's medical review agency for refusing to admit that delays in care have affected veterans' health. Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said in a news conference in Washington last week that he plans to remove more VA officials from their positions once he receives more information from the inspector general.

{"input":"A grieving mother was left sickened after her son's jailed killer was pictured laughing  on Facebook. Jay Whiston, 17, was stabbed to death in a savage attack by Edward Redman, who has since been sent to prison. But just months after the murderer was sentenced, he was pictured on Facebook joking with his brother. Jay's mother Caroline Shearer says the online photo shows why prison is seen as a soft touch by many criminals. Just months after Edward Redman (right) was jailed for the murder of 17-year-old Jay Whiston, his brother posted this picture of them together on Facebook, next to the caption: 'Top day with my brother' Redman (left) received a minimum 17-year sentence for the murder of Jay (right), whose mother has slammed prison authorities after the picture of Redman emerged . The photo was posted online by Redman's brother in November, six months after Redman was jailed, next to the caption: 'Top day with my brother'. It shows Redman, dressed in a white T-shirt, smiling as he puts his arm round his brother. When a friend asked the brother when the picture was taken, he replied: 'Today mate'. Jay's mother Ms Shearer has been left furious by the post and has complained to justice authorities. She said: 'It's disgusting. It's the sort of photo you pay to have taken on holiday. This person is in prison for murder - not for pinching a packet of sweets or not paying his council tax. 'He took my son's life. It's not even a year since he was sentenced. No wonder people aren't scared to go to prison.' Mrs Shearer says she will make a formal complaint and has already contacted Essex police commissioner Nick Alston. The photo of Redman was posted by his brother, who captioned the picture: 'Top day with my brother' Mr Alston's office said they understood the shock Jay's family felt and would support her complaint. Photos of serving inmates in jail can only be released with the prison governor's permission. Mrs Shearer said: 'Apparently you can have photos taken in prison. They shouldn't be put on Facebook or social media, but they obviously didn't give a damn.' She has also written to Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling. Redman stabbed Jay in Colchester, Essex in September 2012, at a party which had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter. Jay - described as 'big-hearted' by his family - would have been 20 on Tuesday. Redman, of Colchester, received a life sentence for the murder and was given a minimum sentence of 17 years in jail earlier this year. At Redman's trial, CCTV images were shown which police believe show the moments he realised Jay had died . Redman (left, in red T-shirt) is shown reading messages on his phone before putting his hand to his mouth . At his trial, CCTV emerged from a bus he boarded after the attack, which appeared to show the moment he heard of Jay's death. Redman was shown laughing and joking in the footage, as he reads messages on his phone from friends at the murder scene. His mood suddenly changes as he puts his hand to his mouth, the moment police believe he was told that Jay had died from his wounds. At the end of Redman's trial, Ms Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly emotional victim impact statement. She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out. Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do. 'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb. Jay's heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn't miss it.' The Ministry of Justice originally denied that the picture had been taken in prison, but today have admitted that the photo featuring Redman and his brother was taken in jail. A spokesman said: 'There are strict rules on photographs being taken in prison and we are investigating how this image appeared on Facebook. 'We have apologised for the distress and upset caused to the family of the victim in this case and have taken steps to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.'","output":"Edward Redman was jailed for at least 17 years for murder of Jay Whiston .\nBut just months after he was sentenced, he was pictured on Facebook .\nOnline post by his brother  shows the killer laughing and smiling .\nVictim's mother slams prison authorities for allowing photo to be taken .\nCrime commissioner to support the grieving mother's complaint .\nMinistry of Justice originally denied picture had been taken in prison but today admitted photo of Redman and his brother was taken in the jail ."}

{"input":"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Reeva Steenkamp told Oscar Pistorius she was afraid of him and his temper less than three weeks before he shot and killed her, the judge in his murder trial was told Monday. \"I'm scared of you sometimes, of how you snap at me,\" the South African model told Pistorius in a long chat message. \"You have picked on me incessantly,\" she wrote, calling Pistorius \"nasty\" after he apparently accused her of flirting with someone at a party. \"I was not flirting with anyone today and I feel sick that you suggested that,\" she told him via WhatsApp, according to the police officer who downloaded their chats after Pistorius shot and killed her. \"You do everything to throw tantrums,\" she said, concluding the message: \"I'm certainly very unhappy and sad.\" Police Capt. Francois Moller, who downloaded the messages from Steenkamp's iPhone, said that 90% of the chats between the two were normal and loving. But there were several that accused Pistorius of jealousy and possessiveness. Less than a week before he killed her, she wrote him another long message after he apparently lost his temper with her as they left a public event together. She reached the exit before he did, she wrote, adding: \"I didn't think you would criticize me for doing that, especially so loudly that others could hear.... I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one after we left.\" Pistorius admits that he killed Steenkamp, firing four shots through a closed door in his house in the early hours of February 14, 2013. Three hit her, with the last one probably killing her almost instantly, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy. But Pistorius says he thought she was a nighttime intruder in his pitch-black house and believed he was firing in self-defense. He pleaded not guilty to murder. Read the messages . 'Terrified screaming' Moller's testimony came after a neighbor of Pistorius said on the witness stand that she heard \"terrified, terrified screaming\" the morning the Olympian killed his girlfriend. Questioned by prosecutor Gerrie Nel, Anette Stipp said she awoke early the morning of February 14, 2013, and heard \"terrified, terrified screaming ... It sounds to me as if there's a family murder, why else would she scream like that.\" Stipp described hearing a series of three shots, a woman screaming, also a man screaming, and then three more shots before the screaming stopped. Her husband, Dr. Johan Stipp, testified earlier in the trial. The trial was originally scheduled to last until March 20 but will now continue until the middle of May, the South African court hearing the case said Sunday. Trial extended to mid-May . The trial, which entered its fourth week on Monday, will continue until April 4, then break for a one-week recess before resuming from April 14 until May 16, the Pretoria court announced in a written statement. It said \"all parties involved\" had agreed to the dates. The trial began March 3. There has been intense media interest in the case in South Africa and beyond. Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname \"Blade Runner.\" Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict with the help of two lay people called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. Almost the entire trial has been televised, though individual witnesses can choose not to be shown on television.

Richard Leon Finkbiner, 39, admitted during an interrogation to victimizing at least 100 people, mostly boys 14 to 16 years old, an FBI agent said in a sworn affidavit made public Monday. \"You want to play this game, or you want to be a gay porn star?\" Finkbiner allegedly told one victim when he demanded that he perform sex acts during a video Skype call, the federal complaint said. Finkbiner, arrested at his Brazil, Indiana, home last Friday, is charged with sexual exploitation of children involving two 14-year-old victims identified in Michigan and Maryland, court documents said. It could take months to identify many of the victims seen in thousands of video files found on Finkbiner's computer and other digital devices, said Timothy Horty, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis. \"These victims go into chat rooms, develop a relationship and conversation with someone,\" Horty said. Finkbiner would then capture uncoerced video of the boys, who probably did not know they were talking to a 39-year-old man, he said. Finkbiner would then e-mail them a link to their own video with the threat to publish it on gay porn sites if they did not agree to become his \"cam slave.\" \"I'll add your name and email so if anyone googles u they will see ur video,\" Finkbiner allegedly wrote to a Michigan teen in February. That teen complied, but after a second instance he \"broke down\" from stress, FBI Special Agent Ryan Barrett said. The boy \"became emotional and hysterical, and disclosed to his brother what was happening,\" Barrett said. The brother told their parents, who then contacted the Oakland County, Michigan, Sheriff's Department, he said. An investigator tracked the e-mail address and Skype account to Finkbiner in Indiana, the agent said. An investigator in Prince George's County, Maryland, was also on Finkbiner's trail for a November exchange involving a 14-year-old boy, the complaint said. When shown a photo of the Maryland teen during an interrogation, Finkbiner could not recall the boy specifically because he had \"coerced the production of video and images of so many people engaged in sexually explicit conduct that he could not readily recognize every individual,\" the agent said. A search of his e-mail revealed instances in which one boy begged Finkbiner to leave him alone: \"I'm only a kid and this is against the law so please stop doing this I beg you,\" the boy wrote. \"I wont get caught im a hacker I covered my tracks,\" Finkbiner allegedly replied. If convicted on the initial charges, Finkbiner faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. He is scheduled to appear before a federal judge in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Wednesday. \"Our advice is never friend an individual that you don't know personally,\" Horty said. \"Parents have to know who their children are communicating with on the Internet.\"","output":"The suspect admitted to victimizing at least 100 people, mostly teens, FBI says .\nRichard Finkbiner, 39, allegedly threatened to post teens' videos on gay porn sites .\n\"You want to play this game or you want to be a gay porn star?\" he allegedly told teens .\nIt could take months to identify the victims, a prosecutor's spokesman says ."}
{"input":"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:19 PM on 8th September 2011 . America faced a fresh threat of another pounding from Mother Nature today as three extreme weather fronts began to sweep towards the coastline. Tropical Storm Nate sprang to life in the western Gulf of Mexico on last night, Tropical Storm Maria formed in the Atlantic and Hurricane Katia churned up surf along Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, forecasters said. The trio of tropical cyclones . came during what is traditionally the busiest part of the . June-through-November hurricane season in the Atlantic basin. Cyclones: This satellite image obtained from the NASA\/NOAA GOES Project shows Hurricane Katia (L) and Tropical Storm Maria (R) on September 7, 2011 . Thousands of Americans were fleeing the U.S. East Coast today after being ordered to evacuate during flash floods which have taken two lives. Heavy rains have seen severe weather warnings issued from Maryland to New York early on Thursday morning. In Derry Township, Pennsylvania, an elderly man trying to get water from his basement was killed when the house's foundations collapsed. A motorist in Elizabeth Township, Pennsylvania, was also killed after becoming trapped in their vehicle early on Thursday during extreme weather. Rescue: A woman and her dogs are recovered from their home as the remains of Tropical Storm Lee cause havoc in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania . Damage: A 500-ton crane carrying out repair work on the Washington DC National Cathedral collapsed as thunderstorms struck the city overnight . The National Weather Service issued several flash flood warnings early Thursday for parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Mandatory evacuation orders were also issued across several parts of New York state as officials predicted the rain would worsen on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. 'At . this time of year we are essentially at the peak of the hurricane . season,' said John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Tropical Storm Maria, the 13th named . storm of the 2011 hurricane season, was racing westward across the . tropical Atlantic, with tropical storm watches being issued for the . Leeward Islands, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its . report late Wednesday. The NHC said the government of Antigua has issued a tropical storm watch . for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis and Saint Kitts . in the Leeward Islands. At 11:00pm EST, Maria was located about 1,070 miles . east-southeast of the Leeward Islands and was packing maximum sustained . winds of 50mph, the NHC added. Maria was moving toward the west near 23mph, and . this rapid motion is expected to continue during the next 24 hours, the . NHC said. Gaining strength: Tropical Storm Maria, the 13th named storm of the 2011 hurricane season, is racing westward across the tropical Atlantic . Storm watch: At 11:00pm EST, Maria was located about 1,070 miles east-southeast of the Leeward Islands and was packing maximum sustained winds of 50mph . 'Interests elsewhere in the Leeward Islands, The Virgin Islands and . Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Maria,' the NHC said. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Nate formed in Mexico's Bay of Campeche, prompting the Mexican government to issue storm warnings for its coast from Chilitepec to Celestun. Nate was about 125 miles west of Campeche and had sustained winds of 45mph. It was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday and move slowly north and then northwest toward the Mexican coast, the U.S. forecasters said. Coastal residents in the warning area could start feeling its gusts and rain by Wednesday night, they said. 'Data from the Pemex oil rigs in the Bay of Campeche measured sustained winds of 43 mph gusting to 50 mph,' the U.S. forecasters said. Trajectory: Forecasters predict Tropical Storm Nate will make landfall in Mexico on Monday evening . Satellite: Coastal residents in the warning area felt Nate's gusts and rain on Wednesday night . Crude oil futures rebounded sharply, partly on fears that Nate could disrupt U.S. and Mexican oil and natural gas operations in the Gulf. Nearly 37 per cent of U.S. oil production in the Gulf remained offline from Tropical Storm Lee's trek through the region last weekend, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said. Katia weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. It was a Category 4 at its peak. Katia was centred about 335 miles west-southwest of the island of Bermuda and was expected to pass between the eastern U.S. coast and Bermuda by Thursday. Forecasters said the core of the storm would stay out to sea but Katia was wide enough that its outer squalls could reach the shores of Bermuda, a British territory and global reinsurance hub whose 70,000 residents were under a tropical storm watch. Danger: Even with Katia's centr likely staying well away from the U.S. coast, large swells will impact the East Coast the next few days . Taking a turn: Katia weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm . Katia generated large swells that kicked up the surf and caused dangerous rip currents along the beaches of the Eastern United States, Bermuda and parts of the Bahamas, the forecasters said. Once past Bermuda, Katia was forecast to curve eastward over open seas where it would pose no further threat until it nears Scotland on Monday. By then it will no longer be a tropical system, but could spread out into a larger storm. 'It'll likely be a very big, significant weather system,' Cangialosi said. 'It will evolve into a classic wintertime storm by the time it gets there.'","output":"Tropical Storms Nate and Maria threaten Puerto Rico and Bay of Campeche .\nHurricane Katia and Tropical Storm Lee still causing waves and heavy rainfall .\nTwo killed in severe weather-related incidents in Pennsylvania .\nEvacuation orders served across New York state ."}
{"input":"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 12:10 EST, 3 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 3 July 2013 . A person's view on whether climate change is real or not can be swayed by something as simple as what date they are asked and if the weather is expected for that time of year, a scientist has claimed. Professor Nick Chater, from Warwick Business School, claims that if someone is questioned about climate change on a day in June when it is colder than expected, or raining, they will be more sceptical. Alternatively, if they are asked on a winter's day when the sun is shining they're more likely to believe the phenomenon exists. Some people believe that climate change and global warming is causing the ice caps to melt, pictured, while others deny it exists. A professor from Warwick Business School has now claimed that a person's opinion about climate change can be swayed depending on when in the year the question is asked, the weather, and even what is immediately around them . Chater calls this behaviour 'attribute substitution' and says that it can be applied to other complex issues, too. In the first episode from series two of BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Human Zoo, Chater discusses how people look to find simple shortcuts in things they can see, and their surrounding environment, to solve complex issues, such as the debate around climate change. Attribute substitution \u2013 where a person replaces a complicated question that needs a judgement with a more easily calculated attribute \u2013 underlies these shortcuts. 'When you look at the climate change argument you can see this at play,' said Professor Chater, of Warwick Business School. 'A recent large scale web survey on a single day across the world asked the question \u2018just how much do you believe that climate change is real?\u2019' 'It wanted to see how much that judgment was affected by whether the temperature of the particular location was hotter or colder than average for that time of the year. Research from the Warwick Business School also found that people who are shown the same graph or climate change image, pictured, will interpret it differently, depending on their viewpoint. Believers will read into changes and lines, while sceptics will play them down - even if the line is based on factual data . The research found that if it is hotter than average on the day someone is asked, then the participant is more likely to believe there is such a thing as climate change. Whereas, if it is a colder than average day they tended to be more sceptical. 'It indicates we are being pushed around by very immediate things, like what we see when we look out the window,' added Chater. A separate experiment on students at Warwick Business School showed how the same data could be interpreted differently by those who believe in climate change and those that don\u2019t. Professor Nick Chater claims that people use 'attribute substitution' as a way of using things around them to influence their decisions on complex debates - such as climate change endangering polar bears - so they don't have to think too hard . 'We gave them a graph with a wiggly line on it and asked the students to continue it in the way that seemed most natural,' said Chater. 'We then gave them another wiggly line, but this time it was real data plotting the average global temperature from 1880 to 2010, and told them it was a climate change prediction task and to guess how that graph would continue. 'Then on a scale of one to seven we asked them how worried they were by climate change.' 'We found that if somebody thinks climate change is real, they tend to extrapolate upwards in temperature more than people who have the opposite view. 'That is true when they think the data is about climate change but not true when they see the wiggly pattern has no particular meaning. 'And when people are more sceptical they tend to keep the line flatter.' 'It shows it is very hard for us to look at data in a dispassionate way. 'When we consider how data is going to continue we think both about what it shows so far but also what our general knowledge or beliefs tell us.There is a danger it can mean the data can look different depending on your perspective. 'If I am a climate change sceptic I might look at the same data and think that doesn\u2019t show much of a trend upwards, but somebody who strongly believes in climate change might look at the same data and see a much more alarming trend.' When faced with complex issues, finding shortcuts like attribute substitutions is, Professor Chater adds, a perfectly rational thing to do. 'Attribute substitution is part of a more general tendency to find short-cuts to difficult problems and that gets you quite a long way,' said the Professor of Behavioural Science. 'If you are wondering how large a city is you might think it is famous, it has an enormous river flowing through it, a well-known football team and so think it is a large city. 'It is using available simple information to solve a difficult problem and on the whole that works pretty well. 'We live in an enormously complex world so theses simplifications and short-cuts are essential, even though they produce biases, they allow us to work and behave.'","output":"Professor Nick Chater, from Warwick Business School, believes a person's view on climate change can differ from one day to the next .\nThe weather, the temperature and even what a person can see makes a difference to their viewpoint .\nHe calls this behaviour 'attribute substitution' and says it applies to other areas of life ."}
{"input":"A performance artist wound up in jail after pulling a fake penis out of his pants during a protest at a Miami art show. Kalan Sherrard, an 'avant-garde nihilist subway performer,' familiar to commuters on New York's L train, was with about 30 others protesting the wealthy at Art Basel when he reportedly tried to fight off police trying to get him out of the building. As they tried to remove him from the show, Sherrard decided this was the moment to yank out his surprise. Scroll down for video . Look at me:\u00a0Kalan Sherrard, an 'avant-garde nihilist subway performer' was arrested after pulling a fake penis out on \u00a0police during a protest at Art Basel in Miami . 'The unknown item was discovered to be a prosthetic penis sex toy,' according to a report from Miami Beach Police Officer Alex Delgado as quoted in The Miami Herald. 'The item was impounded.' The officers at first thought it might be a gun. He was charged with disturbing the peace and resisting an officer without violence. The Miami New Times reports that the altercation started at about 4 p.m. when Sherrard and his partner Maria Paz Valenzuela started a disturbance. He was playing with a balloon while she read a manifesto from the Art Basel site. Sherrard was screaming 'F--- Art Basel, F--- all you rich people.' The pair were part of a larger crowd wearing masks and protesting the wealthy. Despite Sherrard's years as a performer, police say they were still completely confused by what statement he intended to convey with the fake penis. 'It's like the chicken crossing the road question,' Detective Vivian Thayer told reporters. In an interview with New York magazine earlier this year, Sherrard said he performed because 'I think it has to do with being really bored of the world, sort of \u2014 both really bored and really interested.' On Thursday Sherrard was busted for 'disorderly conduct' and 'wearing a mask on the street' according ot court documents . Speaking to the Herald after his arrest, Sherrard claimed he was told by security officers he was dressed 'too artistically' to be in the event. After begging strangers for their clothing he claims to have gone on 'a very basic anti-world rant' before security and police took notice and engaged him. Both he and Valenzuela were released the next day after each posted $1,500 in bail . The Miami New Times notes that this was Sherrard's second arrest of the week. On Thursday he was busted for 'disorderly conduct' and 'wearing a mask on the street' according ot court documents. He wrote of that incident: 'Yesterday I was arrested for Dancing and Wearing A Speaking Costume, and imprisoned for 24 hours in Miami-Dade county's series of incarceratory complexes. 'It was a Kafkaesque nightmare of juggling and impossible echoes of choice, but in the end my friends and family came through and bounced me out. Thank you so much. Minus A Day, Plus the complete clarity of repose, withdrawl, meditation and disjuncture, incarceration unfailingly punctuating the entrenchment of white supremacy, privilege, and complicity.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is being handled by Afghan authorities, did not give details on how U.S. authorities came to that conclusion. The National Airlines jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, killing all seven people aboard, officials said. National Airlines specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses. After the crash, the video of a plane crash surfaced, apparently captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle on the base.

Knight Frank, the estate agency which is selling the castle, said Scottish castles can fetch between \u00a35million and \u00a36million, but this three-bedroom version is the cheapest on its books. The same money would buy you \u2018the cupboard space of a flat in Knightsbridge or the downstairs of a small terraced house in Guildford, Surrey\u2019, according to its research department.
